## Operational Toolkit

swarmdo ships a day-to-day operations layer around the swarm. Every command below is in the core CLI — no plugins required.

| Command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `swarmdo usage` | `cost` | Claude Code spend analytics from local transcripts: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `models`, `projects`, `sessions`, live 5-hour `blocks` burn, month-end spend projection on `monthly`, `errors` (tool-failure analytics), `friction` (how often you interrupt Claude mid-turn, which tool was running when you did, and what KIND of errors dominate — NotFound/Permission/Timeout/Network/Syntax/Other — with `--json`/`--csv`; the sniffly axes `errors` left on the table), `cache` (prompt-cache efficiency + $ saved), `diff` (period comparison — day/week/month presets or explicit `--a/--b` ranges, per-model movers), `reflect` (wrapped-style retrospective over `--period 1m\|3m\|6m\|12m`: totals, busiest day, top models + top projects by cost share, longest active-day streak, cost trend, peak local hour, cache read share, delegation ratio (subagent Task calls / total tool calls); `--html` emits a self-contained shareable dashboard, `--json` the raw data), `limits` (quota-cap forecaster — reads Claude Code's official `rate_limits` payload from stdin or `--payload`, projects when the rolling 5h/7d windows hit 100% at the current burn and whether that lands before they reset). The standard views (`daily`/`monthly`/`models`/`projects`/`sessions`) also take `--csv` for a spreadsheet-ready export. Cache-write cost is TTL-aware: 1-hour-TTL writes are priced at 2× base input (not the 1.25× 5-minute rate), read from each transcript's `cache_creation` breakdown |
| `swarmdo usage guard` | — | Budget policy: `--block-usd/--block-tokens/--daily-usd/--monthly-usd` (or `SWARMDO_GUARD_*` env) → ok / warn / over; `--strict` exits 1 only when over — safe for CI and hooks; `--warn-pct`, `--json` |
| `swarmdo hud` | — | Single-pane ops HUD: 5h block burn, task readiness, daemon workers, memory snapshots (`--watch`, `--json`) |
| `swarmdo repair` | `tdd-repair` | Test-Driven Repair — bounded, budget-capped headless `claude` loop fixes source until a failing test passes; dry-run without `--confirm` |
| `swarmdo orchestrate verify/panel` | `orch` | Deterministic multi-agent **verify + vote**: fan out N parallel skeptics (`verify`) or diversified attempts + majority vote (`panel`) on cheap models (`--model`), schema-validated; `--ground` injects relevant memories, `--strict` gates CI, `--demo` runs offline with no key. Also MCP tools `orchestrate_verify`/`orchestrate_panel` + the `SWARMDO_ULTRA` default-thorough agent mode. See [guide](orchestration-user-guide.md) |
| `swarmdo task` | — | Task dependency DAG: create with `--dependencies`, list unblocked work with `task ready`, render with `task graph`; the dispatcher gates on readiness. `task parse-prd <spec.md>` decomposes a PRD/spec into tasks in topological order (dry-run without `--confirm`). `task doctor` (alias `health`) diagnoses the DAG — separates **live-blocked** tasks (waiting on deps that can still complete) from **dead-blocked** ones (a prerequisite failed / was cancelled / is missing → will NEVER run without intervention, with the failed root cause named), and reports a global **deadlock** verdict when pending work exists but nothing is ready and nothing is running. `--ci` exits 1 when the graph is stuck so a dispatch loop can't spin forever (Airflow `upstream_failed` semantics); `--json` for machine output |
| `swarmdo worktree` | `wt` | Git-worktree isolation for parallel agents: `add` / `list` / `diff` / `merge` / `remove` |
| `swarmdo comms` | `mailbox` | Cross-session **cross-tool** agent mailbox (multiplayer swarms): `send -t <session> -m "…"` (`-t all` broadcasts), `inbox` (`-u` unread, `--mark-read`, `--hook`), `read <id>`, `watch` (live-tail). Sessions on the same repo share `.swarmdo/comms/`; identity resolves `--self` → `$SWARMDO_SESSION` (Claude Code) → `$SWARMDO_AGENT` (Codex/Copilot/pi export this) → hostname, so agents on **any** CLI can address each other. `inbox --hook` emits unread mail as `UserPromptSubmit` context and marks it read — wire it with `hooks recipe comms-inbox --apply` so messages surface without polling. Also exposed as MCP tools `comms_send` / `comms_inbox` for any MCP-capable agent |
| `swarmdo transcript` | `tx` | Export any Claude Code session transcript to clean markdown (system noise stripped); `transcript search <query>` full-text search across all sessions; `transcript list` to browse |
| `swarmdo compact` | — | Compress noisy command output before it reaches an LLM: strip ANSI, collapse identical-line runs (`--min-run`), fold consecutive `node_modules` stack frames, window long logs (`--window H:T`). Stdin filter (`npm test 2>&1 \| swarmdo compact`) or command wrap (`swarmdo compact -- npm test`, exit code propagated). Deterministic, zero tokens; distinct from `compress` (caveman, for memory files) |
| `swarmdo codegraph` | `cg` | Queryable index of exported symbols: `index [path]` scans TS/JS (skips node_modules/dist/.d.ts) and persists `.swarm/codegraph.json`; `query <name>` (`--fuzzy`, `--kind`), `file <path>` lists a file's exports, `stats` summarises. Answers "where is X defined / what does file Y export" without grep+read (including ES2020 `export * as ns from '…'` namespace re-exports, which create a real named export; bare `export * from` adds no local name and is skipped; and every declarator of a comma-separated `export const a = 1, b = 2` is indexed, not just the first). Also builds an IMPORT GRAPH: `imports <file>` lists a file's dependencies (relative specs resolved to repo files, externals kept as-is); `importers <file>` (alias `rdeps`) lists reverse deps — "what breaks if I change this file". Resolution follows the TS ESM convention (a `./x.js` spec resolves to `./x.ts`), directory imports to `index.*`, and bare-specifier internal imports resolve through `tsconfig.json` `paths`/`baseUrl` (so a monorepo's `@scope/pkg` cross-package edges are visible to `imports`/`importers`/`affected`/`cycles` instead of treated as external). Available as MCP tools — `codegraph_index`/`query`/`file`/`imports`/`importers`/`stats` (lean profile, on by default) — so agents query the symbol + dependency graph in-session instead of shelling out. MVP: exported top-level symbols + relative-import edges (incremental watch is a follow-up) |
| `swarmdo redact` | — | Detect & mask secrets on the agent data path: an ordered high-confidence rule catalog (AWS/GitHub/GitLab/Anthropic/OpenAI/Google-API/Google-OAuth `ya29.`/Slack/Stripe/SendGrid/Twilio/npm keys, JWTs, RFC 6750 `Authorization: Bearer` tokens, private-key headers) plus a Shannon-entropy fallback for `keyword=value` assignments (keyword set mirrors gitleaks' `generic-api-key` baseline — `password/secret/token/api_key/access_key/auth_token/client_secret/credential/creds/key` — so `PRIVATE_KEY=`/`ENCRYPTION_KEY=`/`DB_CREDENTIAL=` high-entropy values are caught). Stdin filter or command-wrap (exit code propagated); `--scan` reports findings and exits 1 if any secret is present (CI gate); `--scan --sarif` emits a **SARIF 2.1.0** report (pipe to `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` so leaked-secret findings become code-scanning alerts in the Security tab + PR annotations — `|| true` in the CI step so the upload runs; `--source <path>` anchors the alerts onto a repo file since a stream has none); `--keep N`/`--token`/`--allow`/`--no-entropy` tune masking. Sibling of `compact` (de-noise) — this de-secrets. Also MCP tools `redact_text`/`redact_scan` (lean profile) so agents mask before storing to memory. Deterministic, zero tokens |
| `swarmdo pack` | — | Assemble a repo (or subpath) into one promptable context blob — the piece between `codegraph` (query symbols) and `compact` (de-noise a stream). Walks respecting default skips + the repo `.gitignore` (with correct `gitignore(5)` semantics — double-star depth globs `a/**/b` matching zero or more directories, honoring that a negation can't re-include a file whose parent directory is excluded, and — matching `git check-ignore` — treating a trailing-slash pattern like `build/` as **directory-only** so it prunes a `build/` directory but never drops a regular file named `build`) + comma-separated glob `--include`/`--exclude`, skips binaries and files over `--max-file-size` KiB (default 512), and renders `--style md|xml|json|plain` with an ASCII directory tree (`--no-tree` to omit) and per-file + total ~token estimates (`--tokens` for accounting only, `--json` to machine-read it). `-o/--output` writes to a file; `--redact` runs each file through the redact engine so no secrets land in the bundle. Deterministic — byte-identical output for the same inputs. (MCP tool is a follow-up; bundles are large) |
| `swarmdo env` | — | Reconcile the env vars a codebase *references* against what `.env` *declares* — the deterministic drift check that catches "deploy broke because a var was missing." Statically extracts references (`process.env.X`, `process.env['X']`, destructured `const { X, Y } = process.env` incl. rename/default forms, Vite `import.meta.env.X`, `Deno.env.get`, Python `os.environ`/`os.getenv`; Vite builtins like `PROD`/`DEV` skipped) and set-diffs against `.env` into three buckets: **missing** (referenced, not declared → runtime break), **unused** (declared, never referenced), **undocumented** (in `.env`, absent from `.env.example`). `.env` parsing mirrors the reference `dotenv` grammar — dotted/hyphenated keys (`APP.NAME`, `feature-flag`) and the `KEY: value` separator are recognized, not silently dropped. Ubiquitous runtime vars (NODE_ENV/CI/PATH/…) ignored by default; `--ignore` adds more. `--ci` exits 1 on any missing var, `--strict` also on unused/undocumented; `--json` for machine output. Also MCP tool `env_check` (lean profile) so agents check drift in-session before adding a var or approving a deploy |
| `swarmdo license` (alias `licenses`) | — | Dependency license compliance — the counterpart to `security` (which does CVEs, not licenses). Walks `node_modules` (including one level of `@scope`), reads each package's own `package.json`, and classifies the SPDX license (modern `license` string, legacy `{type}` object, and legacy `licenses[]` array → `A OR B`; missing or an npm special value — `SEE LICENSE IN <file>`, `UNLICENSED` — → `UNKNOWN`, so a custom/proprietary license is flagged for review instead of mis-parsed into a garbage id). Checks each against an allow/deny policy with correct **SPDX expression semantics** (parses to disjunctive normal form, `AND` binds tighter than `OR`, parens honored): `--allow MIT,Apache-2.0,ISC` — a dep passes only if some lawful realization is fully allowed, so `MIT AND GPL-3.0` is flagged even though MIT is allowed (GPL-3.0 also applies); `--deny GPL-3.0,AGPL-3.0` — a dep is denied only when *every* branch hits a denied license, so `(MIT OR GPL-3.0)` passes (the MIT choice is lawful) while `GPL-2.0 OR GPL-3.0` with both denied fails. Deprecated bare GNU ids (`GPL-2.0`, still declared by many npm packages) match a policy written in the modern `-only`/`-or-later` form and vice versa, so a legacy-labelled GPL dep can't slip a modern deny-list; the two suffixed forms stay distinct from each other. `--allow-unknown` tolerates unlicensed packages. `--ci` (implied by any policy) exits 1 on violations; `--json` for machine output; bare `swarmdo license` just lists the license breakdown. Also MCP tool `license_check` (deps-in) so agents audit before adding a package or approving a release |
| `swarmdo sbom` | — | Generate a standardized Software Bill of Materials from `package-lock.json` (npm lockfileVersion 2/3) — the machine artifact that compliance, vuln scanners, and regulators (US EO 14028, EU CRA) consume. Each dependency becomes a component with name, version, package-url (`pkg:npm/…`, scope percent-encoded), SPDX license, and a hex integrity hash (converted from the lockfile's SRI base64). Dual/multi-licensed deps whose license is an SPDX **expression** (e.g. `(MIT OR Apache-2.0)`, `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception`) emit CycloneDX `license.expression` — not an invalid `license.id` that strict validators (Dependency-Track, Grype) reject. Each CycloneDX component carries a `scope` — dev-only deps are `excluded`, optional deps `optional`, runtime deps implicit `required` — so scanners don't treat your whole dev toolchain as production runtime risk. `--spec cyclonedx` (default, CycloneDX 1.5) or `--spec spdx` (SPDX 2.3 JSON); `-o` writes a file, `--production` drops dev deps. Output is deterministic (no embedded timestamp), so it diffs cleanly in CI. Complements `license` (this is the manifest; that's the policy gate) and `pack` (that's AI-context prose, this is a dependency manifest) |
| `swarmdo apply` | — | Apply a unified diff to the working tree with FUZZY context matching — the forgiving counterpart to `git apply` for agent-produced patches, which routinely get rejected when the model's context lines drift by a few lines. Locates each hunk by searching for its context near (not only at) the declared line, tolerates leading/trailing context drift up to `--fuzz N` lines (default 2), honors the `\ No newline at end of file` marker so a patch that adds or removes a file's final newline lands byte-identically to `git apply`, and — crucially — lands the hunks it can while reporting precisely which it rejected, instead of all-or-nothing failure. When a hunk's matched block also appears elsewhere in the file (duplicate/boilerplate blocks), it lands on the nearest match but is flagged **⚠ ambiguous** — so you're warned it may have modified the wrong occurrence instead of silently reporting success; `--strict` makes an ambiguous match exit 1. Reads a patch file arg or stdin; `--dry-run` previews, `--partial` writes files even with some rejected hunks; exit 1 if anything was rejected (so CI/agents can branch on it). Also MCP tool `apply_patch` (source+diff in, patched text + per-hunk results out) so an agent can self-apply its diff in-session |
| `swarmdo hotspots` | — | Rank files by CHANGE-RISK mined from git history — the data-driven answer to "where is the technical debt?". Folds `git log --numstat` into a per-file score `risk = commits × log2(1+churn) × authorFactor × recencyWeight`: files that change often, churn heavily, are touched by many hands, and were edited recently rank highest (recency decays over a ~month scale). Sort `--by risk\|churn\|commits\|authors`, scope with a path arg + `--since 90d`, filter `--min-commits N`, limit `--top N`; `--format json` for machine output. The scoring core is pure (git string + injected `now` → ranked list), so it's fully fixture-tested. Pairs with `codegraph` (that maps structure; this maps volatility). Also MCP tool `hotspots` so an agent focuses refactor/test/review effort before it starts. Correctly resolves git's rename notation (`dir/{old => new}/file`, `old/p => new/p`) to the file's current path, so renamed files rank under their real name instead of a garbage phantom entry. Author identity is resolved through `.mailmap` (`%aN`), so a person's name/email variants count as one author instead of inflating the author-spread factor. Modeled on code-maat / "Your Code as a Crime Scene" |
| `swarmdo affected` | — | From a git diff, list the files — and the minimal set of TEST files — that a change could break, by walking `codegraph`'s import graph (the reverse-dependency closure: a change to X affects X, everyone who imports X, everyone who imports them, transitively). The "only run what my change touches" query, à la `nx affected` / `turbo --filter` / `jest --findRelatedTests`. Changed files come from the working tree (staged + unstaged + untracked) or `--base <ref>` (three-dot, i.e. since the merge-base); `--tests` emits just the affected test files one-per-line so you can pipe straight into a runner (`swarmdo affected --tests \| xargs vitest run`), `--format json` gives `{changed, affected, tests, unknown}`. Files the index has never seen are flagged `unknown` (can't see their dependents). Pure reverse-BFS core → fixture-tested; loads the saved codegraph index or builds one on the fly. Also MCP tool `affected` (you pass the changed paths, get impacted files/tests back) so an agent runs only the relevant tests after an edit |
| `swarmdo coupling` | — | Rank file pairs that CHANGE TOGETHER in git history (temporal / co-change coupling) — the EMPIRICAL complement to `affected`'s static import graph. Files that keep landing in the same commit are coupled in practice even with no import edge: a JSON schema and its TS type, a serializer/deserializer split across modules, a feature flag and its consumers, a doc that must track an API — exactly the edits an agent forgets. Folds the same `git log --numstat` dump `hotspots` uses: `degree(A,B) = shared / min(commits(A), commits(B))` ∈ (0,1] (fraction of the rarer file's commits that also touched the other). `--min-shared N` support threshold, `--max-files N` skips sweeping rename/format commits (code-maat noise convention, default 30), `--file <path>` answers "what changes with X?", `--since 90d`, `--top N`, `--csv`, `--format json`. Pure fold → fixture-tested (degree math, min-shared gate, sweeping-commit skip, focus filter, deterministic order). Modeled on code-maat / CodeScene "Change Coupling". Also MCP tool `coupling` (`file` for a "what changes with X?" query) so an agent editing one file sees what historically moves with it — the empirical peer of the `affected` tool — before it commits. Compact `--since` forms (`90d`, `6mo`) now normalize to what git's `--since` actually parses |
| `swarmdo ownership` | — | Map per-file authorship concentration + BUS FACTOR mined from git history — "who owns each file, and what breaks if they leave?" (code-maat main-dev / CodeScene "Knowledge Map"). Folds the same `git log --numstat` dump `hotspots`/`coupling` use into, per file: the dominant author (`owner` — most churn, tie → most commits, tie → name asc), `ownership` share ∈ (0,1] (owner churn / total churn), distinct-author count, and `busFactor` — the fewest top authors whose cumulative churn STRICTLY exceeds 50% (an even 50/50 split is bus factor 2; a 90% author is 1). A bus factor of 1 is flagged `⚠ key-person` — one departure orphans the file. A repo-level truck factor (`repoBusFactor`) answers the same for the whole codebase. Ranking is most-fragile-first (bus factor asc, ownership desc, churn desc, path asc). Scope with a path arg + `--since 90d`, filter `--min-churn N`, limit `--top N`, `--csv` for a staffing spreadsheet, `--format json` (includes the repo truck factor). Author identity folds through `.mailmap` (`%aN`) so one person's name/email variants count as one owner. Pure fold → fixture-tested (acceptance owner/ownership/bus-factor math, even-split & dominant-author cases, commit-tiebreak, rename dedupe, repo truck factor). Also MCP tool `ownership` (params path/since/top/minChurn → ranked JSON + `repoBusFactor`) so an agent about to refactor a file knows if it is a bus-factor-1 key-person risk and who its main-dev reviewer is — completing the agent-callable git-mining trio (hotspots + coupling + ownership). Pairs with `hotspots` (change-risk) and `coupling` (co-change) |
| `swarmdo hidden-coupling` | — | Rank file pairs that CHANGE TOGETHER in git history but have NO import edge connecting them — "logical coupling minus structural coupling", the co-edit `affected` can't see. Joins the two graphs swarmdo already owns: the temporal (co-change) `coupling` from git and the static import graph from `codegraph`, and emits the set difference — pairs with a high co-change `degree` that no `import`/`export` links in either direction. That's a dependency real enough to move two files in lockstep yet invisible in the code: a JSON schema and the type that mirrors it, a serializer/parser split across modules, a config file and its consumers, a doc that must track an API (on THIS repo it surfaces the version trio and `docs/USERGUIDE.md ⇢ mcp-client.ts` — real logical couplings with no code link). Grounded in evolutionary-coupling research (Gall et al., "Detection of Logical Coupling," ICSM 1998) and CodeScene's "surprising" change-coupling. Composes the existing captures verbatim — `computeCoupling` over the same `--numstat` dump + the codegraph index load (`loadIndex ?? scanRepo`) — so ZERO new capture code; a type-only import still counts as a structural link (excluded). `--since`/`--min-shared`/`--max-files`/`--top`/`--csv`/`--format json`. Pure set-difference engine → fixture-tested (acceptance exclusion, direction-agnostic edge, type-only link, unresolved-external ignore, ranking preserved). Builds on `coupling` (#84) + `codegraph`; complements `affected` (static) and `coupling` (temporal) by naming what they DON'T explain |
| `swarmdo standup` | `mine` | Recall WHAT YOU DID since your last working day — a weekend-aware git-history digest that ports git-standup's signature behavior: on Monday it reaches back to Friday (Mon→3 days, Sun→2 days, else→yesterday), so nothing done before the weekend is lost. Power users juggling many repos + AI-agent sessions use it to answer the standup question and to re-orient at the start of a session. Captures `git log --numstat --format=…%aN…%s`, folds commits into per-day buckets (newest day first, newest commit first within a day) with a per-commit diffstat and per-day totals. Defaults to the current git user (`git config user.name`); `--all` shows everyone, `--author <name>` (or a positional arg) targets one person, `--days N` / `--since 2w` override the auto window (the default cutoff is LOCAL midnight N days ago, so the WHOLE last working day is included), `--format json` for `{generated, author, since, count, buckets}`. The weekend math + day-bucketing core is pure (day-of-week int + injected reference date → window; log dump → buckets) so it's fully fixture-tested — no repo needed; renamed files fold through `resolveRenamePath`, binary files count as 0 churn but still count as a touched file. Complements `usage reflect` (Claude token retrospective) and `changelog` (release notes between tags) — neither overlaps |
| `swarmdo commands` | `slash` | HOT/COLD/ORPHAN usage report for a power user's authored `.claude/` surface: which custom slash-commands (`.claude/commands/**/*.md`) and subagents (`.claude/agents/**/*.md`) are actually invoked (**hot**, with counts), which are defined-but-never-invoked (**cold** — prune candidates), and which are invoked-but-not-defined (**orphan** — a typo, a removed file, or a Claude Code builtin). `config lint` validates these files; this is the orthogonal "dead-code report" for the authoring surface. Joins the DEFINED set (discovered with Claude Code's subdir→colon namespacing, so `.claude/commands/sDo/x.md` matches an invoked `/sDo:x`) against INVOCATION counts mined from `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` — the `<command-name>` marker (scoped to user turns, so an assistant merely quoting it never inflates a count) + the `"subagent_type"` field. Defaults to the current project; `--all` counts across every project. `--unused` prints only the cold prune list; `--unused --strict` exits 1 when anything is unused (a CI cleanliness gate); `--json` emits `{commands:{hot,cold,orphan}, agents:{hot,cold,orphan}, …}`. Pure parsers + join → fixture-tested (11 cases); zero transcripts → everything cold (no throw), zero authored files → a clean "nothing authored" message |
| `swarmdo agent bridge` | — | LINK Claude Code's Agent-tool agents to Swarmdo's registry so the two agent systems share ONE view — the fix for "Swarmdo is installed but `swarmdo agent list` is always empty while real agents run." Swarmdo (MCP/CLI/hooks) runs out-of-process and CANNOT call Claude Code's `Agent` tool — only the main loop can spawn real LLM workers — so the honest integration is a BINDING: `agent bridge register -n <claude-agent-name> [-s <session>] [-t <type>] [--task ...]` writes a bound record into Swarmdo's canonical store (`.swarmdo/agents/store.json`, via the same `registerAgent`/`agent_spawn` path — no parallel store) so `swarmdo agent list` / `swarm status` reflect reality. Registering AUTO-SPINS-UP a swarm from the project config (topology/maxAgents/strategy in swarmdo.config.json, else the anti-drift defaults hierarchical/8/specialized) when none is running, and enrolls the agent into it — the second bind JOINS the same swarm, so a whole team coordinates instead of floating unattached (bridge swarms are persistent: created without a host pid so they survive ephemeral CLI invocations rather than being reaped on process exit). `agent bridge list` splits records into Claude-Code-BOUND vs NATIVE with binding detail; `agent bridge sync --live a,b,c` reconciles the live roster against the store (mirrored / unmirrored → need register / orphaned → Claude agent gone), and `--prune` reaps the orphaned bound records (removing them from the agent store AND every swarm roster, idempotent) so stale bindings don't accumulate across sessions — also MCP tool `agent_bridge_prune`; `agent bridge advise "<prompt>"` classifies whether a prompt warrants a swarm and which roles (security→security-auditor-led, refactor→architect-led, feature→full researcher/architect/coder/tester/reviewer pipeline). Also MCP tools `agent_bridge_register` + `agent_bridge_list` so an agent can bind its own children and read the roster mid-task. Pure engine (id derivation, spawn-input build, reconcile diff, prompt classifier) → fixture-tested (16 cases); the store/swarm glue reuses the existing `registerAgent` + a new shared `createSwarm`/`ensureActiveSwarm` (extracted from `swarm_init`, no parallel swarm creation). **Automatic since 1.58.18 (#108):** binding no longer needs a manual step. `swarmdo init` wires a `SubagentStart` hook (`.claude/helpers/agent-bridge-hook.cjs` via `hook-handler.cjs agent-register`) that registers every Claude Code subagent the moment it spawns — auto-forming its swarm — and a `SubagentStop` hook (`agent-terminate`) that marks the record terminated, so `🤖 Agents` decrements when work finishes. The two events correlate on Claude Code's `agent_id`, so stop always terminates the record start created. Calls are fired detached (the CLI costs ~850ms to boot, far too slow to block every spawn), so a new agent appears within ~1s, plus up to the statusline's 60s cache TTL. Previously the spawn-side hook did not exist at all: a `SubagentStart` block had been deleted from the generator as "dead config" after `config lint` (v1.4.6) flagged it against a `HOOK_EVENTS` list that was then missing the event — a false positive that took the only automatic registration path with it and left the statusline counters at 0 regardless of how many agents ran. **Also used by default:** the UserPromptSubmit hook (`router.cjs` `classifyAgentic`) detects an agentic prompt and injects a guarded `[SWARMDO]` directive suggesting the main agent spawn a swarm. That one is advisory only (it cannot itself call the `Agent` tool) and fully try/catch-wrapped, so it never breaks a prompt; suppressed on questions/trivial edits |
| `swarmdo cycles` | — | Find circular import dependencies in the repo, `madge --circular` / dpdm / skott style — the cycles that cause temporal-dead-zone crashes, `undefined` exports at module-eval time, and brittle init order. Detection is provably correct via Tarjan's strongly-connected-components over `codegraph`'s import graph: every SCC with ≥2 files is a group of mutually-importing modules, and a file that imports itself is a one-node cycle. The SCC scan is iterative (no recursion → no stack overflow on deep graphs), O(V+E), and deterministic (sorted). TypeScript `import type`/`export type` edges are **excluded by default** — they erase at compile time (with isolatedModules/verbatimModuleSyntax) so a type-only "cycle" causes none of the runtime bugs above; pass `--include-type-only` for the strict structural view. A pair still counts as cyclic if any import between the two files is a value import (mixed imports keep the edge). `--ci` exits 1 when any cycle exists so you can gate a build/PR; `--format json` gives `{count, cycles, selfLoops}`. Also MCP tool `cycles` so an agent checks after wiring up modules, before it commits. Pure engine → fixture-tested (2-node, 3-node, self-loop, disjoint cycles, diamond-DAG no-false-positive, type-only exclusion) |
| `swarmdo testreport` | — | Parse JUnit-XML or TAP test-result files into a compact structured failure digest — `{passed, failed, skipped, total, durationMs, failures:[{suite, name, file, line, message}]}` — so you (or an agent) get the exact failing tests plus `file:line` and the assertion message, instead of re-reading a wall of log output. JUnit XML is the universal emit format (Vitest, Jest, pytest, Go/gotestsum, PHPUnit…), so this is framework-agnostic; TAP is also supported, and the format is auto-detected (override with `--type junit\|tap`). The `file:line` is lifted from the failure's stack trace (or explicit file/line attributes). `<![CDATA[…]]>`-wrapped failure bodies (how Maven Surefire/Failsafe embed Java stack traces) are unwrapped correctly — the markers never leak into the message, and entities inside CDATA stay literal per the XML spec. Reads a file, a directory (scans `*.xml`/`*.tap`), or stdin (`vitest --reporter=junit \| swarmdo testreport`); `--ci` exits 1 if anything failed, `--top N` caps the list, `--format json` for machine output. A TAP `Bail out!` (a suite that aborts mid-run — e.g. a missing DB) is surfaced as `⚠ suite ABORTED … results incomplete` and fails `--ci`, instead of the aborted run silently looking clean ("0 failed ✓"). TAP `# TODO` tests are counted as `todo` (per the spec, they're "not expected to succeed"), so a `not ok … # TODO` known-incomplete stub isn't reported as a real failure or failed `--ci`. This is the **front-half of the test→fix loop** — hand its failures to `repair`. Also MCP tool `testreport` (raw output string in → structured failures out) so an agent triages a failing suite without scanning logs. Pure parser → fixture-tested, and validated against real Vitest emitter output |
| `swarmdo integrations` | `integrate` | Wire swarmdo into Codex CLI / Copilot CLI / pi via AGENTS.md + MCP config merges, plus `integrations skills` — deploy a curated ~20 cross-agent SKILL.md skills to `~/.agents` / `~/.codex` / `~/.pi` (idempotent, reversible; Claude Code surfaces untouched) |
| `swarmdo changelog` | `notes`, `release-notes` | Release notes from conventional commits; default range is `<lastTag>..HEAD`; `--from/--to/--version/--out/--all/--no-links/--contributors`. `--contributors` (`-c`) appends a `### Contributors` section listing the distinct commit authors in the range (oldest-first), crediting a GitHub `@handle` when the author's email is a github no-reply address. Recognizes git's default `Revert "…"` subject (not just `revert:`) and surfaces it in the Reverts section with the reverted commit's scope, instead of dropping it into the hidden bucket. A commit is only marked breaking on a real `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (line-anchored) or a `type!:` bang — a mere mention of the phrase in prose no longer forces the commit into the Breaking Changes section |
| `swarmdo mcp doctor` | — | Static diagnosis of MCP server configs across `.mcp.json` + `~/.claude.json`: missing binaries, bad URLs, malformed entries |
| `swarmdo permissions` | `perms` | Audit Claude Code permission rules (`permissions.allow`/`deny`/`ask` in `.claude/settings*.json`, `--global` adds `~/.claude`): flags allow↔deny **conflicts** (deny wins → dead allow rule), **over-broad** whole-tool grants (`Bash(*)`), **shadowed** redundant rules, exact **duplicates**, and **malformed** rules. Read-only; `--json`; `--strict` exits 1 on any conflict (CI gate). Static-safety sibling of `config lint` / `mcp doctor` |
| `swarmdo config lint` | — | Statically validate a project's config surfaces — the pure SHAPE layer (no PATH probe, no network) complementing `doctor`/`mcp doctor`: `swarmdo.config.json` enums/ranges/unknown-keys, the `.claude/settings*.json` **hooks** block against Claude Code's schema, `.mcp.json` server shapes, **`.claude/agents/*.md` subagents** (missing `name`/`description`, a `name` **duplicated across files** — CC silently loads only one — a `model` outside `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`/`inherit`, malformed frontmatter, empty body), **custom slash commands (`.claude/commands` tree, nested) + skills (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)** — malformed YAML frontmatter (CC then loads the body with EMPTY metadata so `/cmd` can't auto-match), a bad `effort` enum, a skill missing its required `name`, and two body cross-checks with teeth: an inline `` !`cmd` `` bash-injection placed after a non-whitespace char (CC leaves it literal and NEVER runs it) and an active `` !`cmd` `` whose command no `allowed-tools` Bash rule covers (prompts/blocks instead of pre-approving — reuses the `permissions` glob matcher) — and pre-1.4 sDo-layout leftovers. Deliberately false-positive-safe (does NOT enum-check `model`, which takes aliases + full IDs; only truly-bounded fields). Every rule is pure (parsed input → findings) so it's fully fixture-tested; the command only reads files. `--json`; `--strict` also fails on warnings (CI gate) |
| `swarmdo hooks notify` | — | OS-native desktop notification (`-d`; macOS `osascript`, Linux `notify-send`) |
| `swarmdo hooks memory-inject` | — | Prompt-time semantic memory injection: embeds the prompt, vector-searches AgentDB across `claude-memories`/`auto-memory`/`patterns`, and emits the most relevant stored memories as `UserPromptSubmit` `additionalContext` under a token budget (`--budget`, `--min-relevance`, `--top-k`, `--namespaces`). Hook-safe (never errors, silent when nothing relevant, `SWARMDO_MEMORY_INJECT_DISABLE=1` to disable); `--preview` prints the block for humans instead of hook JSON. Wire it with `hooks recipe memory-inject --apply` |
| `swarmdo hooks guard-bash` | — | PreToolUse/Bash guardrail: reads the hook payload (or `-c "<cmd>"`), classifies the command against a conservative destructive-command denylist (`rm -rf /` `~` or a system path, `curl`/`wget` piped to a shell, force-push to `main`/`master`, `chmod 777`, `dd` to a device, `mkfs`, `> /dev/sd…`, fork bombs) and emits `permissionDecision: "deny"` to hard-block it — the one guardrail that still fires under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Conservative: `rm -rf ./build`, `rm -rf node_modules`, and feature-branch/`--force-with-lease` pushes are allowed. Hook-safe (fail-open, never errors, `SWARMDO_GUARD_BASH_DISABLE=1` to disable); `--preview` shows the verdict. Wire it with `hooks recipe command-guard --apply` |
| `swarmdo hooks recipe` | `recipes` | Install ready-made Claude Code hooks (`notify-done` → Stop, `notify-input` → Notification, `memory-inject` + `comms-inbox` → UserPromptSubmit, `command-guard` → PreToolUse/Bash); dry-run by default, `--apply` writes, idempotent additive merge; targets `settings.local.json` (`--shared` / `--global` to retarget) |
| `swarmdo preset` | `presets` | The 5-tier capability ladder: `minimal` → `basic`★ → `standard` → `advanced` → `max`; `preset list` / `preset info <name>` / `preset info efficiency`; apply with `swarmdo init --preset <name>` |
| `swarmdo profile` | `profiles` | **Session capability profiles**: `ultra` 🦾 / `smart` 🧠★ / `light` 🪶 / `minimal` 🔩. `profile use <name>` (accepts `default`) sets the session levers (`SWARMDO_ULTRA`/`HARNESS`/`ROUTER_NEURAL`/`PONYTAIL`) in `.claude/settings.json` env, flips the local-LLM + efficiency skills, and writes a sourceable `.swarmdo/profile.env` for Codex/Copilot/pi; `list` / `info` / `status` / `clear`. A brand-new session with none set is prompted to pick one. Slash: `/sDo:profile`. See [Session profiles](#session-profiles) |
| `swarmdo memory export -f obsidian` | `-f md` | Render the memory DB as an Obsidian vault: one note per entry (YAML frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]` stay live), per-namespace folders, `INDEX.md` map-of-content |
| `swarmdo memory import -f obsidian` | `-f md` | Sync an edited vault back into the DB (upsert + re-embed); foreign notes in a mixed vault are skipped, never touched. `--watch` keeps syncing live as you edit (burst-coalesced) |
| `swarmdo memory backup` / `revectorize` | — | WAL-safe nightly DB snapshots (keep 7) · repair hash-era vectors |
| `swarmdo compress <file>` | — | Caveman-compress a memory file from any terminal (e2e-verified 33% smaller; `<file>.original.md` backup kept); `--check` for a token-free dry run |
| `swarmdo efficiency` | — | Toggle the caveman + ponytail skills per project (`on` / `off` / `status`) |
| `swarmdo obsidian` | — | Toggle the dual-plane Obsidian memory integration per project — `on` exports a vault + enables sync, `off`, `status`. Slash: `/sDo:obsidian` |
| `swarmdo llm` | — | Toggle the local SwarmLLM inference backend per project (`on` / `off` / `status`); `on` shows the `🧬 LLM` statusline icon. Slash: `/sDo:llm` |

### Session profiles

A **profile** is a one-word answer to "how much swarmdo do you want this session?" It bundles the levers that are otherwise scattered across env vars, config toggles, and skill installs into a named tier you switch on demand — distinct from `swarmdo init --preset`, which is the one-time project *scaffold*. A profile names a base preset for the deeper setup, but applying one is fast and non-destructive.

| | Profile | Base preset | Session levers | What you get |
|---|---------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 🦾 | `ultra` | `max` | `SWARMDO_ULTRA=1 HARNESS=1 ROUTER_NEURAL=1` + local LLM + efficiency | Everything on — correctness/completeness over speed. Highest cost. |
| 🧠 | `smart` ★ | `standard` | `SWARMDO_HARNESS=1 ROUTER_NEURAL=1` + efficiency | The intelligence layer without the heaviest fan-out. **Recommended.** |
| 🪶 | `light` | `basic` | `SWARMDO_HARNESS=1 PONYTAIL=1` + efficiency | Just the light tools — lean, fast, cheap (minimal-by-default agents). |
| 🔩 | `minimal` | `minimal` | `SWARMDO_HARNESS=0` | Bare — plain Claude, no swarmdo flavor injected. Air-gapped / low-power. |

```bash
swarmdo profile list                 # the ladder + which is active
swarmdo profile info ultra           # what a profile turns on + when to use it
swarmdo profile use default          # apply the recommended (smart) profile
swarmdo profile use ultra            # switch — accepts a name or `default`
swarmdo profile status               # the active profile + what's live
swarmdo profile clear                # unset (the next new session offers to pick again)
```

`profile use <name>` writes four things: (1) `swarmdo.config.json` `profile.active` (+ the `llm.enabled` toggle it implies), (2) the profile's `SWARMDO_*` levers into `.claude/settings.json` `env` — dropping any owned lever the new profile doesn't want, so switches are clean, (3) a sourceable **`.swarmdo/profile.env`** so Codex CLI / Copilot CLI / pi that drive the swarmdo MCP server can `source` the same mode, and (4) the caveman + ponytail efficiency skills, present or not. Because Claude Code caches `settings.json` at session start, **env-gated levers take effect next session**; the statusline profile segment and efficiency skills are live immediately.

**New-session prompt.** A brand-new session (or project) with no profile set is nudged once — a `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/helpers/profile-hook.cjs`, deployed by `swarmdo init`) asks the agent to offer you a one-word choice, recommending **smart**. Pick one and it never asks again; `swarmdo profile clear` re-arms it. Also available as the `/sDo:profile` slash command, which opens the chooser interactively.

### Multi-CLI integrations (`swarmdo integrations`)

Swarmdo is not Claude-Code-only. One command wires it into the other agent CLIs:

```bash
swarmdo integrations                      # status across claude / codex / copilot / pi
swarmdo integrations install all          # preview (dry-run is the default)
swarmdo integrations install all --apply  # write
swarmdo integrations skills               # preview the curated cross-agent skills sync
swarmdo integrations skills --apply       # deploy ~20 curated skills to Codex + pi + the shared dir
```

What each target gets:

| Target | Instructions | MCP wiring |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` (created only if absent) | `[mcp_servers.swarmdo]` appended to `~/.codex/config.toml` inside managed markers |
| Copilot CLI | `AGENTS.md` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` pointer | `swarmdo` server merged into `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (other servers preserved) |
| pi | `AGENTS.md` (pi reads it natively) | guidance printed — point pi at `npx -y swarmdo@latest mcp start` |
| Claude Code | read-only status (managed by `swarmdo init`) | never written by this command |

The generated `AGENTS.md` advertises the surface **any** agent can use — the `comms_send` / `comms_inbox` mailbox for multi-agent coordination, the git-analysis commands (`hotspots` / `coupling` / `ownership` / `standup`), `memory_search` / `memory_store`, and `swarm_init` — and tells non-Claude agents to `export SWARMDO_AGENT=<name>` so mailbox replies address them instead of the shared hostname. `swarmdo mcp start` serves every tool by default, so once wired, Codex/Copilot/pi get the full MCP tool set (latest included), not a subset.

Safety properties: every merge is additive and idempotent (re-running applies 0 writes); an existing `AGENTS.md` is never rewritten; unparseable user configs are never clobbered; and the command hard-refuses any write under `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, or `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Cross-agent skills (`swarmdo integrations skills`)

`AGENTS.md` + MCP give the other CLIs swarmdo's *tools*; skills give them swarmdo's *playbooks*. `SKILL.md` is now a cross-agent standard — Codex, pi, Copilot and Cursor all read a `<dir>/SKILL.md` (with `name` + `description` frontmatter) and auto-activate the skill when a request matches its description. swarmdo already ships its surface as `sdo-*` skills, so this is a near-passthrough sync, not a per-tool conversion:

```bash
swarmdo integrations skills                  # preview (dry-run is the default)
swarmdo integrations skills --apply          # deploy the curated ~20
swarmdo integrations skills --targets codex  # scope to one target (shared,codex,pi)
swarmdo integrations skills --remove --apply # uninstall everything it manages
```

Global scope — the curated set lands in three roots so every project the CLI opens sees them:

| Root | Read by |
|------|---------|
| `~/.agents/skills/` | the cross-client shared convention — Codex, pi, Copilot, Cursor |
| `~/.codex/skills/` | Codex's own global dir (guaranteed pickup) |
| `~/.pi/agent/skills/` | pi's own global dir (guaranteed pickup) |

The set is a deliberate ~20-skill allowlist (memory/intelligence, swarm + hive-mind, hooks, the GitHub suite, SPARC, verification, pair-programming, performance, stream-chain, browser, jujutsu); swarmdo-internal `sdo-v3-*` build skills are excluded. On write, `name` is normalized to the skill's directory slug (the cross-agent spec requires `name == dirname`) while the `description` — the field agents match on to decide when to activate — is preserved verbatim.

Safety + lifecycle: the sync is idempotent (re-apply is byte-identical, no churn) and reconciling (a skill dropped from the curated set in a later release is pruned on the next `--apply`). A `.swarmdo-skills.json` manifest at each root records exactly what swarmdo installed, so `--remove` and the reconcile only ever touch those `sdo-*` dirs — your own skills in the same directory are never deleted. Nothing is ever written under `.claude/`; the Claude Code skill surface stays the read-only source. Codex's deprecated `~/.codex/prompts` and Copilot's (nonexistent) custom-slash-command dir are intentionally **not** used — skills are the durable, current path.

### OpenRouter model pool (configurable swarm models)

Swarms are not limited to Anthropic tiers. Declare the OpenRouter models you
want agents to draw from in `swarmdo.config.json`:

```json
"openrouter": {
  "enabled": true,
  "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "models": [
    { "id": "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct", "tier": "haiku",  "note": "cheap bulk work" },
    { "id": "qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct",  "tier": "haiku" },
    { "id": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",            "tier": "sonnet" },
    { "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",         "tier": "opus" }
  ]
}
```

How it behaves:

- **Routing**: when the 3-tier router lands on a tier, it Thompson-samples a
  concrete model among your tier's candidates (per-model priors refine picks
  as outcomes accumulate — ADR-149) and the decision carries
  `openrouterModel` for the execution layer.
- **Execution precedence**: explicit `org/model` slug from the caller → tier
  pick from your pool → `openrouter.defaultModel` → `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL`
  env. Auth via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (override the env var name with
  `apiKeyEnv`); provider selection via `SWARMDO_PROVIDER=openrouter` or
  key-presence, unchanged.
- **Validation**: `swarmdo config lint` validates the section with the same
  parser the runtime uses — bad slugs, duplicate ids, and unknown tiers are
  reported exactly as the runtime would drop them.

### `route serve` — run Claude Code itself on your model pool

The pool above routes *swarm* execution. `swarmdo route serve` extends it to
**Claude Code itself**: it starts a local, Anthropic-compatible proxy that
Claude Code talks to via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, dispatching every request to a
model from your pool — so you can run Claude Code on Llama, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Qwen, or any OpenRouter model, with no vendored proxy or extra process.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
swarmdo route serve                                # → http://127.0.0.1:3456
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 claude    # Claude Code now runs on your pool
```

- **Tier routing**: a request's model hint (`…haiku…`/`…sonnet…`/`…opus…`) maps
  to a pool tier; an explicit `org/model` slug passes straight through.
- **Streaming**: full Anthropic SSE (`message_start … message_stop`), so the
  Claude Code TUI streams token-by-token exactly as normal.
- **Learns your routing (shared)**: each request's success/failure updates the
  per-model Beta priors in swarmdo's shared learned-routing store
  (`.swarm/model-router-state.json`) — the SAME store your swarms' execution
  router uses, so route serve and your agents learn from each other. The pool
  Thompson-samples over the priors, so models that work well for you get picked
  more over time.
- **Resilient**: retryable upstream failures back off and retry.

Needs the same `openrouter` block (`enabled: true` + a model pool) and
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `swarmdo route serve` prints a clear hint if either is
missing. Flags: `--port` (default 3456), `--host` (default 127.0.0.1).

### `route claude` — launch Claude Code with the pool in its model picker

`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=… claude` works, but the pool stays invisible: `/model`
still lists the built-in Anthropic models and subagents inherit the main one.
`swarmdo route claude` renders a Claude Code settings file and launches with it.

```bash
swarmdo route serve &                  # in one terminal
swarmdo route claude                   # in another — Claude Code, running on your pool
swarmdo route claude --print           # inspect the settings without launching
```

What lands in the picker:

| Entry | Routing |
|---|---|
| `Swarmdo Fast` / `Balanced` / `Deep` | **Learned** — Thompson-samples within the haiku/sonnet/opus tier |
| one entry per pool model | **Pinned** — that exact slug, no sampling |

- **Cheap subagents**: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` defaults to your cheapest
  live tier, which is where fan-out cost actually lands. Override with
  `--subagent-model`.
- **No dead tiers**: a tier with no models behind it is never offered, and the
  matching Claude family falls back to the nearest live tier, so a request can't
  dead-end on an empty pool.
- **Your Anthropic credentials stay put**: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is always set
  (a local placeholder when you pass no `--api-key`). Leaving it unset would
  make Claude Code authenticate to whatever `--base-url` points at using your
  real subscription token.

Flags: `--base-url` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3456`), `--api-key` (or
`SWARMDO_ROUTE_API_KEY`), `--subagent-model`, `--settings-file` (default
`~/.swarmdo/claude-settings.json`, written `0600`), `--print`. Any further
arguments are passed through to `claude`.

Because `--base-url` accepts any Anthropic-compatible endpoint, the same command
points Claude Code at a remote router, not just the local proxy.



Quick examples:

```bash
swarmdo usage blocks                              # 5h windows, live burn on the active one
swarmdo usage guard --block-usd 5 --daily-usd 20 --strict
swarmdo hud --watch                               # one screen for the whole install
swarmdo repair --test "npm test -- auth" --confirm
swarmdo changelog --version v1.4.4 --out NOTES.md # → gh release create --notes-file
swarmdo hooks recipe notify-done --apply          # desktop ping when Claude finishes
swarmdo hooks recipe memory-inject --apply        # inject relevant memories into every prompt
swarmdo memory export -o ./vault -f obsidian      # DB → Obsidian vault
swarmdo memory import -i ./vault -f obsidian      # edited vault → DB (re-embedded)
```

> **Slash-command namespace:** every Claude Code surface swarmdo installs is namespaced — commands as `/sDo:<category>:<name>` (e.g. `/sDo:swarm:swarm-init`, `/sDo:statusline`), skills with the `sdo-` prefix (e.g. `/sdo-ponytail`, `/sdo-caveman-compress`). Type `/sDo` and the whole toolkit groups together. Legacy unprefixed copies are removed automatically by `init` / upgrades / `efficiency on`.

## What's new

Recent releases (1.58.7 through alpha.8) shipped four substantial pieces. End-user CLI surface is unchanged — these are substrate improvements that compound on every existing feature.

### `@swarmdo/cli-core` (alpha.5+) — fast lite path for plugin scripts

A new sibling package that handles **memory commands only** (no SQLite, no HNSW, no ONNX). Cold-cache `npx` wall-time drops from ~35s to ~1.5s — a measured **22.9× speedup** for plugin authors.

```bash
# Plugin scripts can opt in via env flag:
const cliPkg = process.env.CLI_CORE === '1'
  ? '@swarmdo/cli-core@alpha'  # ~1.5s cold-cache
  : '@swarmdo/cli@latest';     # ~35s cold-cache (full features)
```

The full `@swarmdo/cli` is unchanged for end users. Reference: [`v3/@swarmdo/cli-core/MIGRATION.md`](../v3/@swarmdo/cli-core/MIGRATION.md). 8 plugin scripts in this repo are already CLI_CORE-aware.

### Thompson sampling model router (alpha.5)

The 3-tier model selector (Haiku / Sonnet / Opus) is now a **cost-adjusted multi-armed bandit** instead of static thresholds. `hooks_model-outcome` calls update Beta(α, β) priors per tier; `hooks_model-route` samples θ ~ Beta(α, β) and picks argmax. After ~50 outcomes the routing distribution self-corrects against tier overuse — no manual threshold tuning. Cost: 45 µs per route call.

### `@swarmdo/neural@3.0.0-alpha.8` — substrate upgrades

Six concrete additions to the neural package:

1. **Persistence** — `serialize()` / `deserialize()` on `SONAManager`, `ReasoningBank`, `PatternLearner`. Process restarts no longer wipe state.
2. **Seedable PRNG** — `Mulberry32` + `setGlobalRng` for reproducible training runs and deterministic tests.
3. **Self-consistency orchestrator** — `selfConsistency(N, op, aggregator)` (Wang et al. 2022). 5–15pp accuracy on reasoning tasks at Nx compute.
4. **Flash Attention + MoE routing** migrated from cli into the package (1,679 LOC moved). Single source of truth.
5. **Retrieval-path observability** — `hnswRetrievalCount` vs `bruteForceRetrievalCount` in stats so you can tell which path your queries actually hit.
6. **80+ npm SEO keywords** — package now discoverable for `ai-agents`, `multi-agent`, `RL`, `LoRA`, `EWC`, etc.

### `agentdb_*-delete` MCP tools (alpha.8)

Three new MCP tools wired through agentdb@3.0.0-alpha.13's native Cypher-routed delete API:

- `agentdb_hierarchical-delete` — calls `ReflexionMemory.deleteEpisode` (graph + vector + SQL all-in-one)
- `agentdb_causal-edge-delete` — calls `GraphDatabaseAdapter.deleteEdgesByEndpoints(from, to, relation?)` (Cypher-injection-safe)
- `agentdb_causal-node-delete` — calls `GraphDatabaseAdapter.deleteNode(id, {cascade: true})` returns native `{deletedNode, deletedEdges}` audit

All wrapped in MutationGuard (fail-closed) + AttestationLog (audit). Unblocks `/adr-index` re-index when ADR files are deleted from disk — stale nodes + dangling `supersedes` / `amends` / `related` / `depends-on` edges are now scrubbable. Closed [#1784](the upstream project (see NOTICE)).

### What didn't change

- Public CLI surface (26 commands, 140+ subcommands)
- Agent registry (60+ agent types)
- Plugin marketplace
- Hooks system (27 hooks + 12 background workers)
- Configuration files (`swarmdo.config.json`, `.env`, etc.)

If you're running `npx swarmdo@latest`, everything you used in 3.6 still works. The above improvements compound underneath.

> **New to Swarmdo?** You don't need to learn 310+ MCP tools or 26 CLI commands. After running `init`, just use Claude Code normally — the hooks system automatically routes tasks to the right agents, learns from successful patterns, and coordinates multi-agent work in the background. The advanced tools exist for fine-grained control when you need it.

---
### Key Capabilities

🤖 **100+ Specialized Agents** - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

🐝 **Coordinated Agent Teams** - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer) patterns.

🧠 **Learns From Your Workflow** - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

🔌 **Works With Any LLM** - Switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

⚡ **Plugs Into Claude Code** - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use swarmdo commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

🔒 **Production-Ready Security** - Built-in protection against prompt injection, input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

🧩 **Extensible Plugin System** - Add custom capabilities with the plugin SDK. Create workers, hooks, providers, and security modules. Share plugins via the decentralized IPFS marketplace.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐝 <strong>Swarm Coordination</strong> — How agents work together</summary>

Agents organize into swarms led by queens that coordinate work, prevent drift, and reach consensus on decisions—even when some agents fail.

| Layer | Components | What It Does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Coordination | Queen, Swarm, Consensus | Manages agent teams (Raft, Byzantine, Gossip) |
| Drift Control | Hierarchical topology, Checkpoints | Prevents agents from going off-task |
| Hive Mind | Queen-led hierarchy, Collective memory | Strategic/tactical/adaptive queens coordinate workers |

- 🧠 **Collective Memory**: Shared knowledge, LRU cache, SQLite persistence with WAL
- ⚡ **Performance**: Fast batch spawning with parallel agent coordination

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>Intelligence & Memory</strong> — How the system learns and remembers</summary>

The system stores successful patterns in vector memory, builds a knowledge graph for structural understanding, learns from outcomes via neural networks, and adapts routing based on what works best.

| Layer | Components | What It Does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Memory | HNSW, AgentDB, Cache | Stores and retrieves patterns with fast HNSW search |
| Knowledge Graph | MemoryGraph, PageRank, Communities | Identifies influential insights, detects clusters (ADR-049) |
| Self-Learning | LearningBridge, SONA, ReasoningBank | Triggers learning from insights, confidence lifecycle (ADR-049) |

| Learning | SONA, MoE, ReasoningBank | Self-improves from results (sub-millisecond pattern matching) |
| Fine-tuning | MicroLoRA, EWC++ | Lightweight adaptation without full retraining |

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Optimization</strong> — How to reduce cost and latency</summary>

Skip expensive LLM calls for simple tasks using WebAssembly transforms, and compress tokens to reduce API costs by 30-50%.

| Layer | Components | What It Does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Agent Booster | WASM, AST analysis | Skips LLM for simple edits (<1ms) |
| Token Optimizer | Compression, Caching | Reduces token usage 30-50% |

</details>

<details>

| Analytics | Metrics, Benchmarks | Monitors performance, finds bottlenecks |

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Task Routing</strong> — Extend your Claude Code subscription by 250%</summary>

Smart routing skips expensive LLM calls when possible. Simple edits use WASM (free), medium tasks use cheaper models. This can extend your Claude Code usage by 250% or save significantly on direct API costs.

| Complexity | Handler | Speed |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Simple | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms |
| Medium | Haiku/Sonnet | ~500ms |
| Complex | Opus + Swarm | 2-5s |

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agent Booster (WASM)</strong> — Skip LLM for simple code transforms</summary>

Agent Booster uses WebAssembly to handle simple code transformations without calling the LLM at all. When the hooks system detects a simple task, it routes directly to Agent Booster for instant results.

**Supported Transform Intents:**

| Intent | What It Does | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `var-to-const` | Convert var/let to const | `var x = 1` → `const x = 1` |
| `add-types` | Add TypeScript type annotations | `function foo(x)` → `function foo(x: string)` |
| `add-error-handling` | Wrap in try/catch | Adds proper error handling |
| `async-await` | Convert promises to async/await | `.then()` chains → `await` |
| `add-logging` | Add console.log statements | Adds debug logging |
| `remove-console` | Strip console.* calls | Removes all console statements |

**Hook Signals:**

When you see these in hook output, the system is telling you how to optimize:

```bash
# Agent Booster available - skip LLM entirely
[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE] Intent: var-to-const
→ Use Edit tool directly, instant (regex-based, no LLM call) than LLM

# Model recommendation for Task tool
[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="haiku"
→ Pass model="haiku" to Task tool for cost savings
```

**Performance:**

| Metric | Agent Booster | LLM Call |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Latency | <1ms | 2-5s |
| Cost | $0 | $0.0002-$0.015 |
| Speedup | **instant (regex-based, no LLM call)** | baseline |

</details>

<details>
<summary>💰 <strong>Token Optimizer</strong> — reduces token usage via pattern caching and smart routing</summary>

The Token Optimizer integrates agentic-flow optimizations to reduce API costs by compressing context and caching results.

**Savings Breakdown:**

| Optimization | Token Savings | How It Works |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ReasoningBank retrieval | -32% | Fetches relevant patterns instead of full context |
| Agent Booster edits | -15% | Simple edits skip LLM entirely |
| Cache (95% hit rate) | -10% | Reuses embeddings and patterns |
| Optimal batch size | -20% | Groups related operations |
| **Combined** | **30-50%** | Stacks multiplicatively |

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { getTokenOptimizer } from '@swarmdo/integration';
const optimizer = await getTokenOptimizer();

// Get compact context (32% fewer tokens)
const ctx = await optimizer.getCompactContext("auth patterns");

// Optimized edit (instant (regex-based, no LLM call) for simple transforms)
await optimizer.optimizedEdit(file, oldStr, newStr, "typescript");

// Optimal config for swarm (100% success rate)
const config = optimizer.getOptimalConfig(agentCount);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <strong>Anti-Drift Swarm Configuration</strong> — Prevent goal drift in multi-agent work</summary>

Complex swarms can drift from their original goals. Swarmdo includes anti-drift defaults that prevent agents from going off-task.

**Recommended Configuration:**

```javascript
// Anti-drift defaults (ALWAYS use for coding tasks)
swarm_init({
  topology: "hierarchical",  // Single coordinator enforces alignment
  maxAgents: 8,              // Smaller team = less drift surface
  strategy: "specialized"    // Clear roles reduce ambiguity
})
```

**Why This Prevents Drift:**

| Setting | Anti-Drift Benefit |
|---------|-------------------|
| `hierarchical` | Coordinator validates each output against goal, catches divergence early |
| `maxAgents: 6-8` | Fewer agents = less coordination overhead, easier alignment |
| `specialized` | Clear boundaries - each agent knows exactly what to do, no overlap |
| `raft` consensus | Leader maintains authoritative state, no conflicting decisions |

**Additional Anti-Drift Measures:**

- Frequent checkpoints via `post-task` hooks
- Shared memory namespace for all agents
- Short task cycles with verification gates
- Hierarchical coordinator reviews all outputs

**Task → Agent Routing (Anti-Drift):**

| Code | Task Type | Recommended Agents |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Bug Fix | coordinator, researcher, coder, tester |
| 3 | Feature | coordinator, architect, coder, tester, reviewer |
| 5 | Refactor | coordinator, architect, coder, reviewer |
| 7 | Performance | coordinator, perf-engineer, coder |
| 9 | Security | coordinator, security-architect, auditor |
| 11 | Memory | coordinator, memory-specialist, perf-engineer |

</details>

### Claude Code: With vs Without Swarmdo

<details>
<summary>🤖 <strong>OpenAI Codex CLI Support</strong> — Full Codex integration with self-learning</summary>

Swarmdo supports both **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex CLI** via the [@swarmdo/codex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swarmdo/codex) package, following the [Agentics Foundation](https://agentics.org) standard.

### Quick Start for Codex

```bash
# Initialize for Codex CLI (creates AGENTS.md instead of CLAUDE.md)
npx swarmdo@latest init --codex

# Full Codex setup with all 137+ skills
npx swarmdo@latest init --codex --full

# Initialize for both platforms (dual mode)
npx swarmdo@latest init --dual
```

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenAI Codex |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Config File | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Skills Dir | `.claude/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Skill Syntax | `/skill-name` | `$skill-name` |
| Settings | `settings.json` | `config.toml` |
| MCP | Native | Via `codex mcp add` |
| Default Model | claude-sonnet | gpt-5.3 |

### Key Concept: Execution Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE-FLOW = ORCHESTRATOR (tracks state, stores memory)       │
│  CODEX = EXECUTOR (writes code, runs commands, implements)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Codex does the work. Claude-flow coordinates and learns.**

### Dual-Mode Integration (Claude Code + Codex)

Run Claude Code for interactive development and spawn headless Codex workers for parallel background tasks:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE CODE (interactive)  ←→  CODEX WORKERS (headless)        │
│  - Main conversation         - Parallel background execution    │
│  - Complex reasoning         - Bulk code generation            │
│  - Architecture decisions    - Test execution                   │
│  - Final integration         - File processing                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```bash
# Spawn parallel Codex workers from Claude Code
claude -p "Analyze src/auth/ for security issues" --session-id "task-1" &
claude -p "Write unit tests for src/api/" --session-id "task-2" &
claude -p "Optimize database queries in src/db/" --session-id "task-3" &
wait  # Wait for all to complete
```

| Dual-Mode Feature | Benefit |
|-------------------|---------|
| Parallel Execution | 4-8x faster for bulk tasks |
| Cost Optimization | Route simple tasks to cheaper workers |
| Context Preservation | Shared memory across platforms |
| Best of Both | Interactive + batch processing |

### Dual-Mode CLI Commands (NEW)

```bash
# List collaboration templates
npx @swarmdo/codex dual templates

# Run feature development swarm (architect → coder → tester → reviewer)
npx @swarmdo/codex dual run --template feature --task "Add user auth"

# Run security audit swarm (scanner → analyzer → fixer)
npx @swarmdo/codex dual run --template security --task "src/auth/"

# Run refactoring swarm (analyzer → planner → refactorer → validator)
npx @swarmdo/codex dual run --template refactor --task "src/legacy/"
```

### Pre-Built Collaboration Templates

| Template | Pipeline | Platforms |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **feature** | architect → coder → tester → reviewer | Claude + Codex |
| **security** | scanner → analyzer → fixer | Codex + Claude |
| **refactor** | analyzer → planner → refactorer → validator | Claude + Codex |

### MCP Integration for Codex

When you run `init --codex`, the MCP server is automatically registered:

```bash
# Verify MCP is registered
codex mcp list

# If not present, add manually:
codex mcp add swarmdo -- npx swarmdo mcp start
```

### Self-Learning Workflow

```
1. LEARN:   memory_search(query="task keywords") → Find similar patterns
2. COORD:   swarm_init(topology="hierarchical") → Set up coordination
3. EXECUTE: YOU write code, run commands       → Codex does real work
4. REMEMBER: memory_store(key, value, namespace="patterns") → Save for future
```

The **Intelligence Loop** (ADR-050) automates this cycle through hooks. Each session automatically:
- Builds a knowledge graph from memory entries (PageRank + Jaccard similarity)
- Injects ranked context into every route decision
- Tracks edit patterns and generates new insights
- Boosts confidence for useful patterns, decays unused ones
- Saves snapshots so you can track improvement with `node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats`

### MCP Tools for Learning

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `memory_search` | Semantic vector search | BEFORE starting any task |
| `memory_store` | Save patterns with embeddings | AFTER completing successfully |
| `swarm_init` | Initialize coordination | Start of complex tasks |
| `agent_spawn` | Register agent roles | Multi-agent workflows |
| `neural_train` | Train on patterns | Periodic improvement |

### 137+ Skills Available

- **Similarity Scoring**: 0-1 (higher = better)
  - Score > 0.7: Strong match, use pattern
  - Score 0.5-0.7: Partial match, adapt
  - Score < 0.5: Weak match, create new

</details>

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize project
npx swarmdo@latest init

# Start MCP server for Claude Code integration
npx swarmdo@latest mcp start

# Spawn a coding agent
npx swarmdo@latest agent spawn -t coder --name my-coder

# Launch a hive-mind swarm with an objective
npx swarmdo@latest hive-mind spawn "Implement user authentication"

# List available agent types
npx swarmdo@latest agent list
```

### Upgrading

```bash
# Update helpers and statusline (preserves your data)
npx swarmdo@latest init upgrade

# Update AND add any missing skills/agents/commands
npx swarmdo@latest init upgrade --add-missing
```

The `--add-missing` flag automatically detects and installs new skills, agents, and commands that were added in newer versions, without overwriting your existing customizations.

### Claude Code MCP Integration

Add swarmdo as an MCP server for seamless integration:

```bash
# Add swarmdo MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add swarmdo -- npx -y swarmdo@latest mcp start

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

Once added, Claude Code can use all 313 swarmdo MCP tools directly:
- `swarm_init` - Initialize agent swarms
- `agent_spawn` - Spawn specialized agents
- `memory_search` - Search patterns with HNSW vector search
- `hooks_route` - Intelligent task routing
- And 255+ more tools...

<summary>🚀 <strong>Key Differentiators</strong> — Self-learning, memory optimization, fault tolerance</summary>

What makes Swarmdo different from other agent frameworks? These 10 capabilities work together to create a system that learns from experience, runs efficiently on any hardware, and keeps working even when things go wrong.

| | Feature | What It Does | Technical Details |
|---|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| 🧠 | **SONA** | Learns which agents perform best for each task type and routes work accordingly | Self-Optimizing Pattern Learning |
| 🔒 | **EWC++** | Preserves learned patterns when training on new ones — no forgetting | Elastic Weight Consolidation prevents catastrophic forgetting |
| 🎯 | **MoE** | Routes tasks through 8 specialized expert networks based on task type | Mixture of 8 Experts with dynamic gating |
| ⚡ | **Flash Attention** | Accelerates attention computation for faster agent responses | Optimized attention via @swarmvector/attention |
| 🌐 | **Hyperbolic Embeddings** | Represents hierarchical code relationships in compact vector space | Poincare ball model for hierarchical data |
| 📦 | **LoRA** | Lightweight model adaptation so agents fit in limited memory | Low-Rank Adaptation via @swarmvector/sona |
| 🗜️ | **Int8 Quantization** | Converts 32-bit weights to 8-bit with minimal accuracy loss | ~4x memory reduction with calibrated integers |
| 🤝 | **Claims System** | Manages task ownership between humans and agents with handoff support | Work ownership with claim/release/handoff protocols |

<summary>💰 <strong>Intelligent 3-Tier Model Routing</strong> — Reduce API costs by routing simple tasks to cheaper models</summary>

Not every task needs the most powerful (and expensive) model. Swarmdo analyzes each request and automatically routes it to the cheapest handler that can do the job well. Simple code transforms skip the LLM entirely using WebAssembly. Medium tasks use faster, cheaper models. Only complex architecture decisions use Opus.

**Cost & Usage Benefits:**

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 💵 **API Cost Reduction** | 75% lower costs by using right-sized models |
| ⏱️ **Claude Max Extension** | More tasks within quota via smart model selection |
| 🚀 **Faster Simple Tasks** | <1ms for transforms vs 2-5s with LLM |
| 🎯 **Zero Wasted Tokens** | Simple edits use 0 tokens (WASM handles them) |

**Routing Tiers:**

| Tier | Handler | Latency | Cost | Use Cases |
|------|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms | $0 | Simple transforms: var→const, add-types, remove-console |
| **2** | Haiku/Sonnet | 500ms-2s | $0.0002-$0.003 | Bug fixes, refactoring, feature implementation |
| **3** | Opus | 2-5s | $0.015 | Architecture, security design, distributed systems |

**Routing:** Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration, sub-millisecond decision latency

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <strong>Spec-Driven Development</strong> — Build complete specs, implement without drift</summary>

Complex projects fail when implementation drifts from the original plan. Swarmdo solves this with a spec-first approach: define your architecture through ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), organize code into DDD bounded contexts, and let the system enforce compliance as agents work. The result is implementations that match specifications — even across multi-agent swarms working in parallel.

**How It Prevents Drift:**

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| 🎯 **Spec-First Planning** | Agents generate ADRs before writing code, capturing requirements and decisions |
| 🔍 **Real-Time Compliance** | Statusline shows ADR compliance %, catches deviations immediately |
| 🚧 **Bounded Contexts** | Each domain (Security, Memory, etc.) has clear boundaries agents can't cross |
| ✅ **Validation Gates** | `hooks progress` blocks merges that violate specifications |
| 🔄 **Living Documentation** | ADRs update automatically as requirements evolve |

**Specification Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Architecture Decision Records** | 70+ ADRs defining system behavior, integration patterns, and security requirements |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | 5 bounded contexts with clean interfaces preventing cross-domain pollution |
| **Automated Spec Generation** | Agents create specs from requirements using SPARC methodology |
| **Drift Detection** | Continuous monitoring flags when code diverges from spec |
| **Hierarchical Coordination** | Queen agent enforces spec compliance across all worker agents |

**DDD Bounded Contexts:**

**Available Groups:** `create`, `issue`, `branch`, `implement`, `test`, `fix`, `optimize`, `monitor`, `security`, `memory`, `all`, `minimal`

**Preset Modes:**
| Mode | Groups | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `develop` | create, implement, test, fix, memory | Active development |
| `pr-review` | branch, fix, monitor, security | Code review |
| `devops` | create, monitor, optimize, security | Infrastructure |

**Precedence:** CLI args (`--tools=X`) > Environment vars > Config file > Default (all)

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Never hardcode API keys in config files checked into version control.**

```bash
# Use environment variables instead
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Or use a .env file (add to .gitignore)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env
```

<summary>🛡️ <strong>@swarmdo/guidance</strong> — Long-horizon governance control plane for Claude Code agents</summary>

### Overview

`@swarmdo/guidance` turns `CLAUDE.md` into a runtime governance system with enforcement gates, cryptographic proofs, and feedback loops. Agents that normally drift after 30 minutes can now operate for days — rules are enforced mechanically at every step, not remembered by the model.

**7-phase pipeline:** Compile → Retrieve → Enforce → Trust → Prove → Defend → Evolve

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compile** | Parses `CLAUDE.md` into typed policy bundles (constitution + task-scoped shards) |
| **Retrieve** | Intent-classified shard retrieval with semantic similarity and risk filters |
| **Enforce** | 4 gates the model cannot bypass (destructive ops, tool allowlist, diff size, secrets) |
| **Trust** | Per-agent trust accumulation with privilege tiers and coherence-driven throttling |
| **Prove** | HMAC-SHA256 hash-chained proof envelopes for cryptographic run auditing |
| **Defend** | Prompt injection, memory poisoning, and inter-agent collusion detection |
| **Evolve** | Optimizer loop that ranks violations, simulates rule changes, and promotes winners |

### Install

```bash
npm install @swarmdo/guidance@alpha
```

### Quick Usage

```typescript
import {
  createCompiler,
  createRetriever,
  createGates,
  createLedger,
  createProofChain,
} from '@swarmdo/guidance';

// Compile CLAUDE.md into a policy bundle
const compiler = createCompiler();
const bundle = await compiler.compile(claudeMdText);

// Retrieve task-relevant rules
const retriever = createRetriever();
await retriever.loadBundle(bundle);
const { shards, policyText } = await retriever.retrieve({
  taskDescription: 'Fix authentication bug in login flow',
});

// Enforce gates on tool calls
const gates = createGates(bundle);
const result = gates.evaluate({ tool: 'bash', args: { command: 'rm -rf /' } });
// result.blocked === true

// Audit with proof chain
const chain = createProofChain({ signingKey: process.env.PROOF_KEY! });
const envelope = chain.seal(runEvent);
chain.verify(envelope); // true — tamper-evident
```

### Key Modules

| Import Path | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|

| `@swarmdo/guidance/gates` | 4 enforcement gates |
| `@swarmdo/guidance/ledger` | Run event logging + evaluators |
| `@swarmdo/guidance/proof` | HMAC-SHA256 proof chain |
| `@swarmdo/guidance/adversarial` | Threat, collusion, memory quorum |
| `@swarmdo/guidance/trust` | Trust accumulation + privilege tiers |
| `@swarmdo/guidance/authority` | Human authority + irreversibility classification |

<summary>☁️ <strong>LLM Providers</strong> — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, and OpenRouter with automatic failover</summary>

> **Model names and pricing move fast**, so this lists the supported *providers* and links each to its live model catalogue rather than hard-coding models (and per-token prices) that go stale. Manage them with `swarmdo providers` (`list`, `add`, `configure`, `test`).

| Provider | Current models | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | [Model catalogue →](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) | Default. Native Claude Code integration, streaming, tool calling, extended thinking. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **OpenAI** | [Model catalogue →](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) | LLM + embeddings, reasoning models, function calling. `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Google (Gemini)** | [Model catalogue →](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) | Long context, multimodal, grounding. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| **Ollama** | [Model library →](https://ollama.com/library) | Local, or Ollama Cloud — run open-weight models (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, …). `OLLAMA_API_KEY` for cloud |

<summary>📊 <strong>Statusline</strong> — Real-time development status for Claude Code</summary>

Real-time development status display integrated directly into Claude Code's status bar. Shows DDD progress, swarm activity, security status, AgentDB metrics, and live session data (model, context usage, cost).

**How It Works:**

Claude Code pipes JSON session data via **stdin** to the statusline script after each assistant message (debounced ~300ms). The script reads this data and combines it with local project metrics to produce a single-line status output.

**Output Format:**
```
▊ Swarmdo v1.58.7 ● upstream  │  ⎇ main  │  Opus 4.8  | ●42% ctx  | $0.15
🏗️ DDD [●●●●○] 4/5  ⚡ HNSW ~4.7x  🐝 Swarms 2  🤖 Agents 12  🟢 CVE 3/3  💾 512MB  🧠 15%  📦 AgentDB ●1.2K vectors
```

| Indicator | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `▊ Swarmdo v1.58.7` | Project header | Always shown |
| `● upstream` | GitHub user | `gh api user` CLI |
| `⎇ main` | Current git branch | `git branch --show-current` |
| `Opus 4.8` | Claude model name | Stdin JSON `model.display_name` |
| `●42% ctx` | Context window usage | Stdin JSON `context_window.used_percentage` |
| `5h 72%⚠ · 7d 12%` / `$0.15` | Cost slot — plan-aware (rate-limit % on subscription, $ on pay-as-you-go) | Stdin JSON + `~/.claude.json` |
| `[●●●●○]` | DDD domain progress bar | `.swarmdo/metrics/v3-progress.json` |
| `⚡ HNSW ~4.7x` | HNSW search speedup | AgentDB file stats |
| `🐝 Swarms 2` | Active swarms (running, non-orphaned) | `.swarmdo/swarm/swarm-state.json` |
| `🤖 Agents 12` | Non-terminated agents | `.swarmdo/agents/store.json` + hive `.swarmdo/agents.json` |
| `🟢 CVE 3/3` | Security CVE remediation | `.swarmdo/security/audit-status.json` |
| `💾 512MB` | Memory usage | Node.js process RSS |
| `🧠 15%` | Intelligence score | Pattern count from AgentDB |
| `📦 AgentDB ●1.2K` | AgentDB vector count | File size estimate (`size / 2KB`) |

**Customizing the cost segment:**

`cost.total_cost_usd` is a client-side estimate from Claude Code that *may differ from your actual bill* and, on subscription plans, is a phantom (you pay a flat fee, not per token). So the slot is **plan-aware by default** (`mode: auto`): it reads the active account (`~/.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`, live each render — correct across account switches, only plan fields) and shows rate-limit windows for subscriptions, a `$` figure for pay-as-you-go. Configure it with `swarmdo statusline --cost-mode …` / `.swarmdo/statusline.json` (full detail in the [Statusline Reference](#-statusline-reference)) or these env overrides:

| Variable | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_MODE` | `auto` (plan-aware) · `dollars` · `limits` · `off`. | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_MODE=limits` |
| `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_SHOW_ACCOUNT` | `1`/`true` prefixes the slot with the account label (default off — screenshare-safe). | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_SHOW_ACCOUNT=1` |
| `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL` | Overrides the leading `$` (dollars mode). Empty string shows the number alone. | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL=⚡` → `⚡1.30` |
| `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_HIDE_COST` | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` removes the segment entirely (same as `mode: off`). | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_HIDE_COST=1` |
| `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_NO_CLI` | Skip the per-render CLI delegation (no subprocess fork): render from local reads + Claude Code's stdin only. Faster and fork-free; detail rows use local fallbacks. | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_NO_CLI=1` |

Set them in the `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code applies it to every session and to the statusline subprocess, and unlike hand-editing the helper it survives `npx swarmdo@latest init --update`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "node .claude/helpers/statusline.cjs" },
  "env": { "SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL": "⚡" }
}
```

Or export them in your shell profile before launching Claude Code:

```bash
export SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL=⚡   # or: export SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_HIDE_COST=1
```

**Setup (Automatic):**

Run `npx swarmdo@latest init` — this generates `.claude/settings.json` with the correct statusline config and creates the helper script at `.claude/helpers/statusline.cjs`.

The generated config uses a **fast local script** (no `npx` cold-start):
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node .claude/helpers/statusline.cjs"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Only `type`, `command`, and `padding` are valid statusLine fields. Do not add `refreshMs`, `enabled`, or other fields — Claude Code will ignore them.

**For Existing Users:**

If your statusline is not updating, run the upgrade command to regenerate helpers and fix the config:
```bash
npx swarmdo@latest init --update --settings
```

This removes invalid config fields and regenerates the statusline helper with stdin support.

**Stdin JSON Protocol:**

Claude Code provides session data via stdin in this format:

## 🧠 Infinite Context & Memory Optimization

Swarmdo eliminates Claude Code's context window ceiling with a real-time memory management system that archives, optimizes, and restores conversation context automatically.

<details>
<summary>♾️ <strong>Context Autopilot</strong> — Never lose context to compaction again</summary>

### The Problem

Claude Code has a finite context window (~200K tokens). When full, it **compacts** — summarizing the conversation and discarding details like exact file paths, tool outputs, decision reasoning, and code snippets. This creates a "context cliff" where Claude loses the ability to reference earlier work.

### The Solution: Context Autopilot (ADR-051)

Swarmdo intercepts the compaction lifecycle with three hooks that make context loss invisible:

```
Every Prompt                    Context Full                    After Compact
     │                              │                              │
     ▼                              ▼                              ▼
UserPromptSubmit              PreCompact                     SessionStart
     │                              │                              │
 Archive turns              Archive + BLOCK              Restore from archive
 to SQLite                  auto-compaction               via additionalContext
 (incremental)              (exit code 2)                (importance-ranked)
     │                              │                              │
     ▼                              ▼                              ▼
 Track tokens              Manual /compact               Seamless continuation
 Report % used             still allowed                 with full history
```

### How Memory is Optimized

| Layer | What It Does | When |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Proactive Archiving** | Every user prompt archives new turns to SQLite with SHA-256 dedup | Every prompt |
| **Token Tracking** | Reads actual API `usage` data (input + cache tokens) for accurate % | Every prompt |
| **Compaction Blocking** | PreCompact hook returns exit code 2 to cancel auto-compaction | When context fills |
| **Manual Compact** | `/compact` is allowed — archives first, resets autopilot, then compresses | On user request |
| **Importance Ranking** | Entries scored by `recency × frequency × richness` for smart retrieval | On restore |
| **Access Tracking** | Restored entries get access_count++ creating a relevance feedback loop | On restore |
| **Auto-Pruning** | Never-accessed entries older than 30 days are automatically removed | On PreCompact |
| **Content Compaction** | Old session entries trimmed to summaries, reducing archive storage | Manual or scheduled |
| **SwarmVector Sync** | SQLite entries auto-replicated to PostgreSQL when configured | On PreCompact |

### Optimization Thresholds

| Zone | Threshold | Statusline | Action |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| OK | <70% | `🛡️ 43% 86.7K ⊘` (green) | Normal operation, track growth trend |
| Warning | 70-85% | `🛡️ 72% 144K ⊘` (yellow) | Flag approaching limit, archive aggressively |
| Optimize | 85%+ | `🛡️ 88% 176K ⟳2` (red) | Prune stale entries, keep responses concise |

### Real-Time Statusline

The statusline shows live context metrics read from `autopilot-state.json`:

```
🛡️  45% 89.2K ⊘  🧠 86%
│    │   │     │    │   │
│    │   │     │    │   └─ Intelligence score (learning.json + patterns + archive)
│    │   │     │    └──── Intelligence indicator
│    │   │     └───────── No prune cycles (⊘) or prune count (⟳N)
│    │   └─────────────── Token count (actual API usage)
│    └─────────────────── Context percentage used
└──────────────────────── Autopilot active (shield icon)
```

### Storage Tiers

| Tier | Backend | Storage | Features |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **SQLite** (default) | `.swarmdo/data/transcript-archive.db` | WAL mode, indexed queries, ACID, importance ranking |
| 2 | **SwarmVector PostgreSQL** | Configurable remote | TB-scale, pgvector embeddings, GNN search |
| 3 | **AgentDB + HNSW** | In-memory + persist | HNSW-indexed semantic search |
| 4 | **JSON** (fallback) | `.swarmdo/data/transcript-archive.json` | Zero dependencies, always works |

### Configuration

```bash
# Context Autopilot (all have sensible defaults)
SWARMDO_CONTEXT_AUTOPILOT=true        # Enable/disable autopilot (default: true)
SWARMDO_CONTEXT_WINDOW=200000         # Context window size in tokens
SWARMDO_AUTOPILOT_WARN=0.70           # Warning threshold (70%)
SWARMDO_AUTOPILOT_PRUNE=0.85          # Optimization threshold (85%)
SWARMDO_COMPACT_RESTORE_BUDGET=4000   # Max chars restored after compaction
SWARMDO_RETENTION_DAYS=30             # Auto-prune never-accessed entries
SWARMDO_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=true            # Importance ranking + pruning + sync
```

### Commands

```bash
# Check archive status and autopilot state
node .claude/helpers/context-persistence-hook.mjs status

# Manual compact (archives first, then allows Claude Code to compress)
# Use /compact in Claude Code — autopilot allows manual, blocks auto

# Query archive directly
sqlite3 .swarmdo/data/transcript-archive.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(LENGTH(content)) FROM transcript_entries;"
```

## 💾 Storage: RVF (SwarmVector Format)

Swarmdo uses RVF — a compact binary storage format that replaces the 18MB sql.js WASM dependency with pure TypeScript. No native compilation, no WASM downloads, works everywhere Node.js runs.

<details>
<summary>💾 <strong>RVF Storage</strong> — Binary format, vector search, migration, and auto-selection</summary>

### Why RVF?

Previous versions shipped sql.js (18MB WASM blob) for persistent storage. This caused slow cold starts, large installs, and compatibility issues on ARM/Alpine. RVF eliminates all of that:

| | Before (sql.js) | After (RVF) |
|---|---|---|
| **Install size** | +18MB WASM | 0 extra deps |
| **Cold start** | ~2s (WASM compile) | <50ms |
| **Platform support** | x86/ARM issues | Runs everywhere |
| **Native deps** | Optional hnswlib-node | Pure TypeScript fallback |

### How it works

RVF files use a simple binary layout: a 4-byte magic header (`RVF\0`), a JSON metadata section, then packed entries. Each module has its own format variant:

| Format | Magic Bytes | Used By | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `RVF\0` | `0x52564600` | Memory backend | Entries + HNSW index |
| `RVEC` | `0x52564543` | Embedding cache | Cached vectors with LRU eviction |
| `RVFL` | `0x5256464C` | Event log | Append-only domain events |
| `RVLS` | — | Learning store | SONA patterns + trajectories |

### Storage auto-selection

You don't need to pick a backend. The `DatabaseProvider` tries each option in order and uses the first one available:

```
RVF (pure TypeScript) → better-sqlite3 (native) → sql.js (WASM) → JSON (fallback)
```

RVF is always available since it has zero dependencies, so it wins by default. If you have `better-sqlite3` installed (e.g., for advanced queries), it gets priority.

### Vector search with HnswLite

RVF includes `HnswLite` — a pure TypeScript implementation of the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for fast nearest-neighbor search. It's used automatically when storing entries with embeddings.

```typescript
import { RvfBackend } from '@swarmdo/memory';

const backend = new RvfBackend({ databasePath: './memory.rvf' });
await backend.initialize();

// Store entries — embeddings are indexed automatically
await backend.store({ id: '1', key: 'auth-pattern', content: '...', embedding: vector });

// Search by similarity
const results = await backend.search({ embedding: queryVector, limit: 10 });
```

Supports cosine, dot product, and Euclidean distance metrics. For large datasets (100K+ entries), install `hnswlib-node` for the native implementation — the backend switches automatically.

### Migrating from older formats

The `RvfMigrator` converts between JSON files, SQLite databases, and RVF:

```typescript
import { RvfMigrator } from '@swarmdo/memory';

// Auto-detect format and migrate
await RvfMigrator.autoMigrate('./old-memory.db', './memory.rvf');

// Or be explicit
await RvfMigrator.fromJsonFile('./backup.json', './memory.rvf');
await RvfMigrator.fromSqlite('./legacy.db', './memory.rvf');

// Export back to JSON for inspection
await RvfMigrator.toJsonFile('./memory.rvf', './export.json');
```

Format detection works by reading the first few bytes of the file — no file extension guessing.

### Crash safety

All write operations use atomic writes: data goes to a temporary file first, then a single `rename()` call swaps it into place. If the process crashes mid-write, the old file stays intact.

- **Memory backend**: `file.rvf.tmp` → `file.rvf`
- **Embedding cache**: `file.rvec.tmp.{random}` → `file.rvec`
- **Event log**: Append-only (no overwrite needed)

### SONA learning persistence

The `PersistentSonaCoordinator` stores learning patterns and trajectories in RVF format, so agents retain knowledge across sessions:

```typescript
import { PersistentSonaCoordinator } from '@swarmdo/memory';

const sona = new PersistentSonaCoordinator({
  storePath: './data/sona-learning.rvls',
});
await sona.initialize();

// Patterns survive restarts
const similar = sona.findSimilarPatterns(embedding, 5);
sona.storePattern('routing', embedding);
await sona.shutdown(); // persists to disk
```

### Security

RVF validates inputs at every boundary:

- **Path validation** — null bytes and traversal attempts are rejected
- **Header validation** — corrupted files are detected before parsing
- **Payload limits** — event log entries cap at 100MB to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Dimension validation** — embedding dimensions must be between 1 and 10,000
- **Concurrent write protection** — a lock flag prevents overlapping disk flushes

### Configuration

```bash
# Environment variables
SWARMDO_MEMORY_BACKEND=hybrid   # auto-selects RVF
SWARMDO_MEMORY_PATH=./data/memory

# Or via CLI
swarmdo memory init --force
swarmdo config set memory.backend hybrid
```

## 🧠 Intelligence & Learning

Self-learning hooks, pattern recognition, and intelligent task routing.

<details>
<summary>🪝 <strong>Hooks, Event Hooks, Workers & Pattern Intelligence</strong></summary>

### What Are Hooks?

Hooks intercept operations (file edits, commands, tasks) and learn from outcomes. Unlike static automation, hooks **improve over time** by tracking what works and applying those patterns to future tasks.

| Concept | Plain English | Technical Details |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Hook** | Code that runs before/after an action | Event listener with pre/post lifecycle |
| **Pattern** | A learned strategy that worked | Vector embedding stored in ReasoningBank |
| **Trajectory** | Recording of actions → outcomes | RL episode for SONA training |
| **Routing** | Picking the best agent for a task | MoE-based classifier with learned weights |

### How Hooks Learn (4-Step Pipeline)

### Hook Signals (ADR-026 Model Routing)

When hooks run, they emit signals that guide routing decisions. Watch for these in hook output:

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE]` | Simple transform detected, skip LLM | Use Edit tool directly (instant (regex-based, no LLM call), $0) |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="haiku"` | Low complexity task | Pass `model: "haiku"` to Task tool |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="sonnet"` | Medium complexity task | Pass `model: "sonnet"` to Task tool |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="opus"` | High complexity task | Pass `model: "opus"` to Task tool |

**Agent Booster Intents** (handled without LLM):
- `var-to-const` - Convert var/let to const
- `add-types` - Add TypeScript type annotations
- `add-error-handling` - Wrap in try/catch
- `async-await` - Convert promises to async/await
- `add-logging` - Add console.log statements
- `remove-console` - Strip console.* calls

**Example Hook Output:**
```bash
$ npx swarmdo@latest hooks pre-task --description "convert var to const in utils.ts"

[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE] Intent: var-to-const
Recommendation: Use Edit tool directly
Performance: <1ms (instant (regex-based, no LLM call) than LLM)
Cost: $0
```

### Intelligence Loop (ADR-050)

The intelligence loop wires PageRank-ranked memory into the hook system. Every session builds a knowledge graph that improves over time:

```
SessionStart:
  session-restore  → intelligence.init()
    → Read MEMORY.md / auto-memory-store.json
    → Build graph (nodes + similarity/temporal edges)
    → Compute PageRank
    → "[INTELLIGENCE] Loaded 13 patterns, 12 edges"

UserPrompt:
  route            → intelligence.getContext(prompt)
    → Jaccard-match prompt against pre-ranked entries
    → Inject top-5 patterns into Claude's context:

    [INTELLIGENCE] Relevant patterns for this task:
      * (0.95) HNSW gives HNSW-indexed search [rank #1, 12x accessed]
      * (0.88) London School TDD preferred [rank #3, 8x accessed]

PostEdit:
  post-edit        → intelligence.recordEdit(file)
    → Append to pending-insights.jsonl (<2ms)

SessionEnd:
  session-end      → intelligence.consolidate()
    → Process pending insights (3+ edits → new entry)
    → Confidence boost for accessed patterns (+0.03)
    → Confidence decay for unused patterns (-0.005/day)
    → Recompute PageRank, rebuild edges
    → Save snapshot for trend tracking
```

**Measuring improvement:**

```bash
# Human-readable diagnostics
node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats

# JSON output for scripting
node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats --json

# Or via intelligence.cjs directly
node .claude/helpers/intelligence.cjs stats
```

The stats command shows:

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Graph** | Node/edge count, density % |
| **Confidence** | Min/max/mean/median across all patterns |
| **Access** | Total accesses, patterns used vs never accessed |
| **PageRank** | Sum (~1.0), highest-ranked node |
| **Top Patterns** | Top 10 by composite score with access counts |
| **Last Delta** | Changes since previous session (confidence shift, access delta) |
| **Trend** | Over all sessions: IMPROVING / DECLINING / STABLE |

**Example output:**
```

<summary>🎫 <strong>Claims & Work Coordination</strong> — Human-Agent Task Management</summary>

The Claims system manages **who is working on what** — whether human or agent. It prevents conflicts, enables handoffs, and balances work across your team.

### Why Use Claims?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Two agents working on the same file | Claims prevent duplicate work |
| Agent stuck on a task | Mark as stealable, another agent takes over |
| Need to hand off work | Structured handoff with context |
| Unbalanced workload | Automatic rebalancing across agents |

### How Claims Work

```

### Route Commands

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `route task` | Get agent recommendation | `npx swarmdo@latest route task "implement OAuth2"` |
| `route explain` | Understand routing decision | `npx swarmdo@latest route explain "task"` |
| `route coverage` | Route based on test coverage | `npx swarmdo@latest route coverage` |

### Example: Route a Task

```bash
npx swarmdo@latest route task "refactor authentication to use JWT"

# Output:
# ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║                    ROUTING RECOMMENDATION                     ║
# ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
# ║ Task: "refactor authentication to use JWT"                    ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Recommended Agent: security-architect                         ║
# ║ Confidence: 94%                                                ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Why this agent?                                                ║
# ║ • Domain match: authentication, security                       ║
# ║ • Historical success: 12/13 similar tasks (92%)                ║
# ║ • Expertise: JWT, OAuth, session management                    ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Alternative agents:                                            ║
# ║ • coder (78% confidence) - general implementation              ║
# ║ • backend-dev (71% confidence) - API expertise                 ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Coverage-Aware Routing

Routes tasks to agents based on **test coverage gaps**:

```bash
npx swarmdo@latest route coverage

# Finds untested code and routes to tester agent:
# • src/auth/jwt.ts - 23% coverage → tester
# • src/api/users.ts - 45% coverage → tester
# • src/utils/crypto.ts - 0% coverage → security-architect + tester
```

### Routing Hooks

```bash
# Route via hooks (preferred)
npx swarmdo@latest hooks route "implement caching layer" --include-explanation

# Record outcome for learning
npx swarmdo@latest hooks post-task --task-id "task-123" --success true --agent coder
```

### How Q-Learning Improves Over Time

| Iteration | Action | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Route "auth task" → coder | ❌ Failed (missing security context) |
| 2 | Route "auth task" → security-architect | ✅ Success |
| 3 | Route "auth task" → security-architect | ✅ Success |
| N | Route "auth task" → security-architect | 94% confidence (learned) |

The system **remembers** what works and applies it to future similar tasks.

## 💻 Programmatic Usage

Use Swarmdo packages directly in your applications.

<details>
<summary>💻 <strong>Programmatic SDK</strong> — Use Swarmdo in Your Code</summary>

Use Swarmdo packages directly in your TypeScript/JavaScript applications.

### Installation

```bash
# Install specific packages
npm install @swarmdo/cli @swarmdo/memory @swarmdo/swarm

# Or install everything
npm install swarmdo@latest
```

### Quick Examples

<details open>
<summary>🧠 <strong>Memory & Vector Search</strong></summary>

```typescript
import { AgentDB } from '@swarmdo/memory';

// Initialize with HNSW indexing (~4.7x faster)
const db = new AgentDB({
  path: './data/memory',
  hnsw: { m: 16, efConstruction: 200 }
});

// Store patterns with embeddings
await db.store('auth-pattern', {
  content: 'JWT authentication flow',
  domain: 'security',
  embedding: await db.embed('JWT authentication flow')
});

// Semantic search
const results = await db.search('how to authenticate users', {
  topK: 5,
  minSimilarity: 0.7
});

console.log(results);
// [{ key: 'auth-pattern', similarity: 0.92, content: '...' }]
```

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Initialize memory database
npx swarmdo@latest memory init --force

# Store patterns
npx swarmdo@latest memory store --key "pattern-auth" --value "JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
npx swarmdo@latest memory store --key "pattern-cache" --value "Redis caching for API responses"

# Build HNSW index for HNSW-indexed search
npx swarmdo@latest memory search --query "authentication" --build-hnsw

# Semantic search (uses HNSW if built)
npx swarmdo@latest memory search --query "how to cache data" --limit 5

# Cross-encoder rerank for the best top-k (opt-in; composes with --smart).
# Retrieves a wider candidate pool, then a cross-encoder (ADR-083) scores each
# (query, entry) pair jointly and reorders. Lazy-loads a ~30MB model on first
# use; if it can't load, results fall back to the pre-rerank order (never errors).
npx swarmdo@latest memory search --query "how to cache data" --rerank
npx swarmdo@latest memory search --query "auth patterns" --smart --rerank

# Distill a session transcript into atomic facts (opt-in; dry-run by default).
# Dry-run prints the plan (session file, #turns, model, budget cap) and makes no call:
npx swarmdo@latest memory distill
# Confirm to make ONE budget-capped headless `claude` call that extracts the facts:
npx swarmdo@latest memory distill --confirm --model haiku --max-budget-usd 0.50
# Facts land in the `distilled` namespace, found by normal search (incl. --rerank):
npx swarmdo@latest memory search --namespace distilled --rerank --query "caching decisions"
# Needs the local `claude` CLI and respects SWARMDO_HEADLESS (0/false/off blocks the call).
# Secrets in facts are redacted before storage; near-duplicates are skipped; 'latest'
# is scoped to the current project. Full walkthrough: docs/memory-distill-user-guide.md

# List and manage entries
npx swarmdo@latest memory list --namespace patterns
npx swarmdo@latest memory stats
```

<summary>📊 <strong>Embeddings — Multi-Provider with Fine-Tuning & Hyperbolic Space</strong></summary>

### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Latency | Quality | Cost | Offline | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|------|---------|----------|
| **Agentic-Flow (ONNX)** | ~3ms | Good | Free | ✅ | Production (faster with ONNX runtime) |
| **OpenAI** | ~50-100ms | Excellent | $0.02-0.13/1M | ❌ | Highest quality |
| **Transformers.js** | ~230ms | Good | Free | ✅ | Local development |
| **Mock** | <1ms | N/A | Free | ✅ | Testing |

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createEmbeddingService, cosineSimilarity } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

// Auto-selects best provider (agentic-flow ONNX preferred)
const embeddings = await createEmbeddingService({
  provider: 'auto',        // agentic-flow → transformers → mock
  autoInstall: true,       // Auto-install agentic-flow if missing
  dimensions: 384,
  cache: { enabled: true, maxSize: 10000 }
});

// Generate embeddings
const result = await embeddings.embed('authentication patterns');
console.log(`Generated in ${result.latencyMs}ms`);

// Batch processing with cache stats
const batch = await embeddings.embedBatch([
  'user login flow',
  'password reset',
  'session management'
]);
console.log(`Cache hits: ${batch.cacheStats?.hits}`);

// Compare similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(batch.embeddings[0], batch.embeddings[1]);
// 0.94 (high similarity)
```

### Document Chunking

Split long documents into overlapping chunks:

```typescript
import { chunkText, estimateTokens } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

const result = chunkText(longDocument, {
  maxChunkSize: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  strategy: 'sentence',  // 'character' | 'sentence' | 'paragraph' | 'token'
  minChunkSize: 100,
});

console.log(`Created ${result.totalChunks} chunks`);
result.chunks.forEach((chunk, i) => {
  console.log(`Chunk ${i}: ${chunk.length} chars, ~${chunk.tokenCount} tokens`);
});
```

### Normalization Options

Normalize embeddings for consistent similarity:

```typescript
import { l2Normalize, l1Normalize, minMaxNormalize, zScoreNormalize } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

// L2 normalize (unit vector - most common for cosine similarity)
const l2 = l2Normalize(embedding);  // [0.6, 0.8, 0]

// Other normalizations
const l1 = l1Normalize(embedding);       // Manhattan norm = 1
const minMax = minMaxNormalize(embedding); // Values in [0, 1]
const zScore = zScoreNormalize(embedding); // Mean 0, std 1
```

### Hyperbolic Embeddings (Poincaré Ball)

Better representation for hierarchical code structures:

```typescript
import {
  euclideanToPoincare,
  hyperbolicDistance,
  hyperbolicCentroid,
  mobiusAdd,
} from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

// Convert to hyperbolic space (better for tree-like structures)
const poincare = euclideanToPoincare(embedding);

// Hyperbolic distance (geodesic in Poincaré ball)
const dist = hyperbolicDistance(embedding1, embedding2);

// Hyperbolic centroid (Fréchet mean)
const centroid = hyperbolicCentroid([embed1, embed2, embed3]);

// Why hyperbolic? Better for:
// - Parent-child relationships (class inheritance)
// - Directory hierarchies
// - Taxonomy structures
// - Lower distortion for tree-like data
```

### Neural Substrate Integration (Fine-Tuning)

Access neural features for embedding adaptation:

```typescript
import { createNeuralService, isNeuralAvailable } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

// Check availability
const available = await isNeuralAvailable();

// Create neural service
const neural = createNeuralService({ dimension: 384 });
await neural.init();

if (neural.isAvailable()) {
  // Semantic drift detection (catches context drift)
  await neural.setDriftBaseline('Initial context');
  const drift = await neural.detectDrift('New input to check');
  console.log('Drift:', drift?.trend);  // 'stable' | 'drifting' | 'accelerating'

  // Memory with interference detection
  const stored = await neural.storeMemory('mem-1', 'Important pattern');
  console.log('Interference:', stored?.interference);

  // Recall by similarity
  const memories = await neural.recallMemories('query', 5);

  // Coherence calibration (fine-tune quality detection)
  await neural.calibrateCoherence(['good output 1', 'good output 2']);
  const coherence = await neural.checkCoherence('Output to verify');

  // Swarm coordination via embeddings
  await neural.addSwarmAgent('agent-1', 'researcher');
  const coordination = await neural.coordinateSwarm('Complex task');
}
```

### Persistent SQLite Cache

Long-term embedding storage with LRU eviction:

```typescript
import { PersistentEmbeddingCache } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';

const cache = new PersistentEmbeddingCache({
  dbPath: './embeddings.db',
  maxSize: 10000,
  ttlMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 7 days
});

await cache.init();
await cache.set('my text', new Float32Array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]));
const embedding = await cache.get('my text');

const stats = await cache.getStats();
console.log(`Hit rate: ${(stats.hitRate * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

## 🔗 Ecosystem & Integrations

Core infrastructure packages powering Swarmdo's intelligence layer.

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agentic-Flow Integration</strong> — Core AI Infrastructure</summary>

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/agentic-flow?color=blue&label=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow)
[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/agentic-flow?color=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-upstream%2Fagentic--flow-blue?logo=github)](the upstream project (see NOTICE))

Swarmdo is built on top of **[agentic-flow](the upstream project (see NOTICE))**, a production-ready AI agent orchestration platform. This deep integration provides instant (regex-based, no LLM call) code transformations, learning memory, and geometric intelligence.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agentic-flow

# Or run directly with npx
npx agentic-flow --help

# Start MCP server
npx agentic-flow mcp start

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add agentic-flow -- npx agentic-flow mcp start
```

### Core Components

| Component | Description | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Agent Booster** | Rust/WASM code transformations | instant (regex-based, no LLM call), $0 cost |
| **ReasoningBank** | Learning memory with HNSW | HNSW-indexed search |
| **ONNX Embeddings** | Local vector generation | faster with ONNX runtime than Transformers.js |
| **Embedding Geometry** | Geometric intelligence layer | <3ms latency |
| **Multi-Model Router** | Intelligent model selection | 30-50% cost savings |
| **QUIC Transport** | High-performance transport | Ultra-low latency |

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agent Booster</strong> — 352x Faster Code Transformations</summary>

Agent Booster performs mechanical code edits without calling LLM APIs:

| Operation | LLM API | Agent Booster | Speedup |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Variable rename | 352ms | 1ms | **352x** |
| Add import | 420ms | 1ms | **420x** |
| Function signature | 380ms | 1ms | **380x** |
| Code formatting | 290ms | 1ms | **290x** |
| **1000 files** | 5.87 min | 1 second | **352x** |

```bash
# Single file edit
npx agentic-flow agent-booster edit \
  --file src/api.ts \
  --instructions "Add error handling" \
  --code 'try { ... } catch (error) { ... }'

# Batch rename across codebase
npx agentic-flow agent-booster batch-rename \
  --pattern "getUserData" \
  --replacement "fetchUserProfile" \
  --glob "src/**/*.ts"

# Parse LLM markdown output
npx agentic-flow agent-booster parse-md response.md
```

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Variable/function renaming across files
- ✅ Adding imports, type annotations
- ✅ Code formatting, signature updates
- ❌ Complex refactoring (use LLM)
- ❌ Bug fixes requiring reasoning (use LLM)

**ROI Example:** 1000 edits/day saves $10/day + 5.86 minutes = **$3,650/year**

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>ReasoningBank</strong> — Learning Memory System</summary>

ReasoningBank stores successful patterns for future retrieval:

```typescript
import { ReasoningBank } from 'agentic-flow/reasoningbank';

const bank = new ReasoningBank();

// Record successful outcome
await bank.recordOutcome({
  task: 'implement authentication',
  outcome: 'JWT with refresh tokens',
  success: true,
  context: { framework: 'express' }
});

// Retrieve similar patterns for new task
const patterns = await bank.retrieveSimilar('add user login', { k: 5 });
// Returns past successful auth implementations

// Judge and distill learnings
await bank.judge(trajectoryId, 'success');
await bank.distill();  // Extract key patterns
await bank.consolidate();  // Prevent forgetting (EWC++)
```

**4-Step Pipeline:**
1. **RETRIEVE** — Fetch relevant patterns via HNSW (~4.7x faster)
2. **JUDGE** — Evaluate outcomes with verdicts
3. **DISTILL** — Extract key learnings via LoRA
4. **CONSOLIDATE** — Prevent catastrophic forgetting (EWC++)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔢 <strong>ONNX Embeddings</strong> — 75x Faster Local Vectors</summary>

Generate embeddings locally without API calls:

```typescript
import { getOptimizedEmbedder, cosineSimilarity } from 'agentic-flow/embeddings';

const embedder = getOptimizedEmbedder();
await embedder.init();

// Generate embedding (3ms local vs 230ms Transformers.js)
const vector = await embedder.embed('authentication patterns');

// Batch processing
const vectors = await embedder.embedBatch([
  'user login flow',
  'password reset',
  'session management'
]);

// Calculate similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(vectors[0], vectors[1]);
```

| Provider | Latency | Cost | Offline |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Agentic-Flow ONNX** | ~3ms | Free | ✅ |
| Transformers.js | ~230ms | Free | ✅ |
| OpenAI | ~50-100ms | $0.02-0.13/1M | ❌ |

</details>

<details>
<summary>📐 <strong>Embedding Geometry</strong> — Intelligence as Geometry</summary>

Advanced patterns treating embeddings as geometric control surfaces:

**Semantic Drift Detection:**
```typescript
import { getOptimizedEmbedder, cosineSimilarity } from 'agentic-flow/embeddings';

const embedder = getOptimizedEmbedder();
let baseline: Float32Array;

// Set baseline context
baseline = await embedder.embed('User asking about API authentication');

// Check for drift
const current = await embedder.embed(userMessage);
const drift = 1 - cosineSimilarity(baseline, current);

if (drift > 0.15) {
  console.log('Semantic drift detected - escalate');
}
```

**Memory Physics:**
- Temporal decay (forgetting)
- Interference detection (nearby memories weaken)
- Memory consolidation (merge similar patterns)

**Swarm Coordination:**
```typescript
// Agents coordinate via embedding positions, not messages
const agentPosition = await embedder.embed(agentRole);
const taskPosition = await embedder.embed(currentTask);

// Geometric alignment for task routing
const alignment = cosineSimilarity(agentPosition, taskPosition);
```

**Coherence Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Detect model degradation/poisoning via embedding drift
await monitor.calibrate(knownGoodOutputs);
const result = await monitor.check(newOutput);
if (result.anomalyScore > 1.5) {
  console.log('WARNING: Output drifting from baseline');
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔀 <strong>Multi-Model Router</strong> — Intelligent Model Selection</summary>

Route tasks to optimal models based on complexity:

```typescript
import { ModelRouter } from 'agentic-flow/router';

const router = new ModelRouter();

// Automatic routing based on task complexity
const result = await router.route({
  task: 'Add console.log to function',
  preferCost: true
});
// Returns: { model: 'haiku', reason: 'simple task, low complexity' }

const result2 = await router.route({
  task: 'Design distributed caching architecture'
});
// Returns: { model: 'opus', reason: 'complex architecture, high reasoning' }
```

| Complexity | Model | Cost | Use Case |
|------------|-------|------|----------|
| Agent Booster intent | **Skip LLM** | $0 | var→const, add-types |
| Low (<30%) | **Haiku** | $0.0002 | Simple fixes, docs |
| Medium (30-70%) | **Sonnet** | $0.003 | Features, debugging |
| High (>70%) | **Opus** | $0.015 | Architecture, security |

**Savings: 30-50% on LLM costs through intelligent routing**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install swarmvector (auto-detects native vs WASM)
npm install swarmvector

# Or run directly
npx swarmvector --help

# Start Postgres for centralized coordination
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 upstream/swarmvector-postgres
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import swarmvector from 'swarmvector';

// Initialize vector database
const db = new swarmvector.VectorDB(384); // 384 dimensions

// Insert vectors
await db.insert('doc1', embedding1);
await db.insert('doc2', embedding2);

// Search (returns top-k similar)
const results = await db.search(queryEmbedding, 10);

// Graph queries with Cypher
await db.execute("CREATE (a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:KNOWS]->(b:Person {name: 'Bob'})");
const friends = await db.execute("MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(friend) RETURN friend.name");

// GNN-enhanced search (self-learning)
const layer = new swarmvector.GNNLayer(384, 256, 4);
const enhanced = layer.forward(query, neighbors, weights);

// Compression (2-32x memory reduction)
const compressed = swarmvector.compress(embedding, 0.3); // 30% quality threshold
```

<summary>⚡ <strong>@swarmvector/attention</strong> — Flash Attention (unverified (no benchmark) Speedup)</summary>

Native Rust implementation of Flash Attention for transformer computations:

```typescript
import { FlashAttention } from '@swarmvector/attention';

const attention = new FlashAttention({
  blockSize: 32,      // L1 cache optimized
  dimensions: 384,
  temperature: 1.0,
  useCPUOptimizations: true
});

// Compute attention with O(N) memory instead of O(N²)
const result = attention.attention(queries, keys, values);
console.log(`Computed in ${result.computeTimeMs}ms`);

// Benchmark against naive implementation
const bench = attention.benchmark(512, 384, 5);
console.log(`Speedup: ${bench.speedup}x`);
console.log(`Memory reduction: ${bench.memoryReduction}x`);
```

**Key Optimizations:**
- Block-wise computation (fits L1 cache)
- 8x loop unrolling for dot products
- Top-K sparse attention (12% of keys)
- Two-stage screening for large key sets
- Online softmax for numerical stability

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>@swarmvector/sona</strong> — Self-Optimizing Pattern Learning</summary>

SONA provides runtime-adaptive learning with minimal overhead:

```typescript
import { SONA } from '@swarmvector/sona';

const sona = new SONA({
  enableLoRA: true,       // Low-rank adaptation
  enableEWC: true,        // Elastic Weight Consolidation
  learningRate: 0.001
});

// Start learning trajectory
const trajectory = sona.startTrajectory('task-123');

// Record steps during execution
trajectory.recordStep({
  type: 'observation',
  content: 'Found authentication bug'
});
trajectory.recordStep({
  type: 'action',
  content: 'Applied JWT validation fix'
});

// Complete trajectory with verdict
await trajectory.complete('success');

// EWC++ consolidation (prevents forgetting)
await sona.consolidate();
```

**Features:**
- **LoRA**: Low-rank adaptation for efficient fine-tuning
- **EWC++**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **ReasoningBank**: Pattern storage with similarity search
- **Sub-millisecond**: sub-millisecond pattern matching overhead

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 <strong>@swarmvector/graph-node</strong> — Native Graph Database</summary>

High-performance graph database with Cypher query support:

```typescript
import { GraphDB } from '@swarmvector/graph-node';

const db = new GraphDB({ path: './data/graph' });

// Create nodes and relationships
await db.query(`
  CREATE (a:Agent {name: 'coder', type: 'specialist'})
  CREATE (b:Agent {name: 'reviewer', type: 'specialist'})
  CREATE (a)-[:COLLABORATES_WITH {weight: 0.9}]->(b)
`);

// Query patterns
const result = await db.query(`
  MATCH (a:Agent)-[r:COLLABORATES_WITH]->(b:Agent)
  WHERE r.weight > 0.8
  RETURN a.name, b.name, r.weight
`);

// Hypergraph support for multi-agent coordination
await db.createHyperedge(['agent-1', 'agent-2', 'agent-3'], {
  type: 'consensus',
  topic: 'architecture-decision'
});
```

**Performance vs WASM:**
- 10x faster query execution
- Native memory management
- Zero-copy data transfer

</details>

### Integration with Swarmdo

Swarmdo automatically uses SwarmVector when available:

```typescript
// Swarmdo detects and uses native swarmvector
import { getVectorStore } from '@swarmdo/memory';

const store = await getVectorStore();
// Uses swarmvector if installed, falls back to sql.js

// HNSW-indexed search (~4.7x faster)
const results = await store.search(queryVector, 10);

// Flash Attention for pattern matching
const attention = await getFlashAttention();
const similarity = attention.attention(queries, keys, values);
```

assertNoSensitiveData(mockLogger.logs, ['password', 'token', 'secret']);
```

### Performance Testing

```typescript
import { createPerformanceTestHelper, TEST_CONFIG } from '@swarmdo/testing';

const perf = createPerformanceTestHelper();

perf.startMeasurement('search');
await search(query);
const duration = perf.endMeasurement('search');

// Get statistics
const stats = perf.getStats('search');
console.log(`Avg: ${stats.avg}ms, P95: ${stats.p95}ms`);

// Performance targets
console.log(TEST_CONFIG.FLASH_ATTENTION_SPEEDUP_MIN); // 2.49
console.log(TEST_CONFIG.AGENTDB_SEARCH_IMPROVEMENT_MAX); // 12500
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Do | Don't |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Mock Dependencies** | `mockRepo.findById.mockResolvedValue(user)` | Call real database |
| **Use Fixtures** | `agentConfigs.queenCoordinator` | Inline object literals |
| **Test Behavior** | `expect(mockNotifier.notify).toHaveBeenCalled()` | `expect(service._queue.length).toBe(1)` |
| **Isolate Tests** | `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` | Share state between tests |
| **Verify Interactions** | `expect(save).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(notify)` | Assert implementation details |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Reference

Environment setup, configuration options, and platform support.

### 🔡 Slash Command Reference

Swarmdo ships **146 `/sDo:` slash commands** (installed into `.claude/commands/sDo/` by `swarmdo init`, or user-wide in `~/.claude/commands/sDo/`) plus **38 `/sdo-` skills**. In Claude Code, type `/sDo:` (or `/sdo-`) to browse them; most wrap a `npx swarmdo …` CLI call or an MCP tool, so the same capability also works from a plain shell.

**How to use them**

- **Discover:** type `/sDo:` in Claude Code — the palette lists every command by category.
- **Namespaced:** commands live in category folders, so you invoke them as `/sDo:<category>/<name>` (e.g. `/sDo:swarm/research`). The five entry-point commands are un-namespaced (e.g. `/sDo:swarmdo-help`).
- **Start here:** `/sDo:swarmdo-help` (overview) · `/sDo:swarmdo-swarm` (spin up a swarm) · `/sDo:statusline` (configure the statusline) · `/sDo:swarmdo-memory` (memory).
- **Cross-harness:** the same capabilities are reachable from **Codex, Copilot, and pi** via the Swarmdo MCP tools + `AGENTS.md` (`swarmdo integrations install <codex|copilot|pi>`); Codex and pi can additionally run the commands as native prompt files.

> **Note on legacy stubs.** A handful of scaffolding stubs inherited from the upstream template (e.g. `/sDo:swarm/swarm-status`, `/sDo:swarm/swarm-modes` and other `swarm-*` / `hive-mind-*` duplicates) map to non-existent subcommands and are being cleaned up. Prefer the primary command in each group (e.g. `/sDo:swarm/swarm`, or the CLI `swarmdo swarm status`). Descriptions below come from each command's own source file.

### 📊 Statusline Reference

Swarmdo's statusline renders a **header line** plus optional **detail rows**. Choose which segments show with **`/sDo:statusline`** (a checklist, or a preset), or edit `.swarmdo/statusline.json`; the `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE` env var overrides the file. The helper (`.claude/helpers/statusline.cjs`) calls `swarmdo hooks statusline --json` on each refresh.

**Presets**

| Preset | Segments |
|---|---|
| `full` | version, project, branch, model, duration, context, cost, domains, swarm, architecture, agentdb |
| `compact` | version, project, branch, model, context, cost, swarm |
| `minimal` | project, branch, model, context |

**Header segments** (one line, `│`-separated)

| Segment | Shows | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | `▊ Swarmdo Vx.y.z` — the installed version | package version |
| `project` | `● <name>` — project name (cyan when a swarm is coordinating, dim when idle) | git / directory name |
| `branch` | `⏇ <branch>` + change indicator + `↑<ahead>` / `↓<behind>` | git |
| `model` | active Claude model name | Claude Code stdin JSON |
| `duration` | `⏱ <time>` — session wall-clock | Claude Code stdin JSON |
| `context` | `● N% ctx` — context-window used (green → yellow → red) | Claude Code stdin JSON |
| `cost` | **plan-aware** — rate-limit % on subscription accounts, `$N.NN` on pay-as-you-go | Claude Code stdin JSON + `~/.claude.json` |

**The `cost` slot — plan-aware**

Claude Code's `cost.total_cost_usd` is a *client-side estimate* that reads as a phantom on flat-fee subscription plans (Max/Team/Enterprise/Pro), where you don't pay per token. So the slot is **plan-aware**: it reads the active account (`~/.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`, live on every render so it stays correct across account switches — only plan fields, never tokens) and picks the metric:

- **subscription** → the official rate-limit windows, e.g. `5h 72%⚠ · 7d 12%` (green → yellow when ≥80% or on-pace-to-exhaust-before-reset → red at 100%), parsed from Claude Code's `rate_limits` payload.
- **pay-as-you-go** (API / console) → the real `$N.NN`.

| Setting | Config (`.swarmdo/statusline.json`) | Env override | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mode | `"cost": { "mode": "auto" }` — `auto`·`dollars`·`limits`·`off` | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_MODE` | `swarmdo statusline --cost-mode <m>` |
| Account label | `"cost": { "showAccount": true }` (default `false`, silent) | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_SHOW_ACCOUNT` | `swarmdo statusline --show-account` / `--hide-account` |
| Symbol / hide (legacy) | — | `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL`, `SWARMDO_STATUSLINE_HIDE_COST` | — |

`auto` is the default; precedence is env → project config → global config → default. `--show-account` prefixes the slot with the account's display name — off by default so it stays screenshare-safe. Set once for every project with `swarmdo statusline --cost-mode auto --global`.

**Detail rows** (each is its own line)

| Segment | Shows | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `domains` | `🏗️ DDD Domains [▓▓▓░] N/5` + a performance marker | `.swarmdo/metrics/v3-progress.json` |
| `swarm` | the swarm/agent/health row (broken out below) | multiple |
| `architecture` | `🔧 ADRs ●impl/total │ DDD ●N% │ Security ●status` | `docs/adr/`, domain progress, security audit |
| `agentdb` | `📊 Vectors ●N⚡ │ Size │ Tests ●N (~cases) │ MCP ●on/total ◆DB` | AgentDB stats, test files, MCP config |

**The `swarm` row, item by item**

| Item | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `🐝 Swarms N` | **Active swarms** — running, non-orphaned entries in `.swarmdo/swarm/swarm-state.json` |
| `🤖 Agents M` | **Non-terminated agents** in the registry (`.swarmdo/agents/store.json` + hive `.swarmdo/agents.json`) |
| `🪝 on/total` | Enabled / total Swarmdo hooks |
| `sec <status>` | Security scan — `✓` clean · `stale` · `N!` open CVEs · `—` none |
| `💾 <n>MB` | Node process memory (RSS) |
| `🧠 <n>%` | Intelligence score (learned-pattern density) |

Colors are consistent across the line: **green** = active / healthy, **dim** = idle / none, **yellow** = partial / stale, **red** = needs attention. `🐝 Swarms` and `🤖 Agents` are two *distinct* counts — swarms are coordination containers, agents are the workers inside them.

### Common Issues

**MCP server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart MCP server
npx swarmdo@latest mcp start
```

**Agent spawn failures**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -m
# Reduce max agents if memory constrained
export SWARMDO_MAX_AGENTS=5
```

**Pattern search returning no results**
```bash
# Verify patterns are stored
npx swarmdo@latest hooks metrics
# Re-run pretraining if empty
npx swarmdo@latest hooks pretrain
```

**Windows path issues**
```powershell
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes
$env:SWARMDO_MEMORY_PATH = "./data"
# Or use absolute path
$env:SWARMDO_MEMORY_PATH = "C:/Users/name/swarmdo/data"
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
# Or use nvm to manage Node.js
```

**High memory usage**
```bash
# Enable garbage collection
node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/swarmdo
# Reduce HNSW parameters for lower memory
export SWARMDO_HNSW_M=8
export SWARMDO_HNSW_EF=100
```

### Breaking Changes

| Change | Claude-Flow v2 | Swarmdo | Impact |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| **Package Structure** | `swarmdo` | `@swarmdo/*` (scoped) | Update imports |
| **Memory Backend** | JSON files | AgentDB + HNSW | Faster search |
| **Hooks System** | Basic patterns | ReasoningBank + SONA | Self-learning |
| **Security** | Manual validation | Automatic strict mode | More secure |
| **CLI Commands** | Flat structure | Nested subcommands | New syntax |
| **Config Format** | `.swarmdo/config.json` | `swarmdo.config.json` | Update path |

### Step-by-Step Migration

```bash
# STEP 1: Backup existing data (CRITICAL)
cp -r ./data ./data-backup-v2
cp -r ./.swarmdo ./.swarmdo-backup-v2

# STEP 2: Check migration status
npx swarmdo@latest migrate status

# STEP 3: Run migration with dry-run first
npx swarmdo@latest migrate run --dry-run

# STEP 4: Execute migration
npx swarmdo@latest migrate run --from v2

# STEP 5: Verify migration
npx swarmdo@latest migrate verify

# STEP 6: Initialize learning
npx swarmdo@latest hooks pretrain
npx swarmdo@latest doctor --fix
```

### Command Changes Reference

| Claude-Flow v2 | Swarmdo | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `swarmdo start` | `swarmdo mcp start` | MCP is explicit |
| `swarmdo init` | `swarmdo init wizard` | Interactive setup (subcommand, not a flag) |
| `swarmdo spawn <type>` | `swarmdo agent spawn -t <type>` | Nested under `agent` |
| `swarmdo swarm create` | `swarmdo swarm init --topology mesh` | Explicit topology |
| `--pattern-store path` | `--memory-backend agentdb` | Backend selection |
| `hooks record` | `hooks post-edit --success true` | Explicit success flag |
| `memory get <key>` | `memory retrieve --key <key>` | Explicit flag |
| `memory set <key> <value>` | `memory store --key <key> --value <value>` | Explicit flags |
| `neural learn` | `hooks intelligence --mode learn` | Under hooks |
| `config set key value` | `config set --key key --value value` | Explicit flags |

### Configuration Migration

**V2 Config (`.swarmdo/config.json`)**:
```json
{
  "mode": "basic",
  "patternStore": "./patterns",
  "maxAgents": 10
}
```

**Swarmdo Config (`swarmdo.config.json`)**:
```json
{
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "memory": {
    "type": "hybrid",
    "path": "./data",
    "hnsw": { "m": 16, "ef": 200 }
  },
  "swarm": {
    "topology": "hierarchical",
    "maxAgents": 15,
    "strategy": "specialized"
  },
  "security": { "mode": "strict" },
  "neural": { "enabled": true, "sona": true }
}
```

### Import Changes

```typescript
// V2 (deprecated)
import { ClaudeFlow, Agent, Memory } from 'swarmdo';

// Swarmdo (new)
import { ClaudeFlowClient } from '@swarmdo/cli';
import { AgentDB } from '@swarmdo/memory';
import { ThreatDetector } from '@swarmdo/security';
import { HNSWIndex } from '@swarmdo/embeddings';
```

### Rollback Procedure

If migration fails, you can rollback:

```bash
# Check rollback options
npx swarmdo@latest migrate rollback --list

# Rollback to V2
npx swarmdo@latest migrate rollback --to v2

# Restore backup manually if needed
rm -rf ./data
cp -r ./data-backup-v2 ./data
```

### Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Verify all agents spawn correctly: `npx swarmdo@latest agent list`
- [ ] Check memory search works: `npx swarmdo@latest memory search -q "test"`
- [ ] Confirm MCP server starts: `npx swarmdo@latest mcp start`
- [ ] Run doctor diagnostics: `npx swarmdo@latest doctor`
- [ ] Test a simple swarm: `npx swarmdo@latest swarm init --topology mesh`
- [ ] Bootstrap learning: `npx swarmdo@latest hooks pretrain`

### Common Migration Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` | Old package references | Update imports to `@swarmdo/*` |
| `Config not found` | Path change | Rename to `swarmdo.config.json` |
| `Memory backend error` | Schema change | Run `migrate run` to convert |
| `Hooks not working` | New hook names | Use new hook commands |
| `Agent spawn fails` | Type name changes | Check `agent list` for new types |
